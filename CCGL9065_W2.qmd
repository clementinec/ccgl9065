# This Week's Battlefield

## Two Sides. Two Food Futures.

## The Core Tension

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
| PRO-CLIMATE | PRO-DEVELOPMENT |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Reduce meat consumption | Improve meat production |
| Plant-based is the future | Choice and tradition matter |
| Systemic dietary change | Individual freedom |
| Global emissions focus | Local livelihoods focus |
| Health + planet aligned | Economic stability priority |

**This tension defines every food policy debate.**

- Did a little bit of work on Notion
- Skipped the Group Discussion


# Logistic Questions

- Tutorial Assignments?
  - Pick your time slots
  - CIC-Badged so starting off with reflective writing for T1/T2 (W2/W3)
- Notion Pages and how that works?
  - Refer to Annoucement Email on publishing and submitting
  - Submit <span style="color:red">URL Only</span> shared as **published site**
  - Due EOD every Wednesday

# CCGL9065: Our Response to Climate Change

## Address Common Concerns on Pro-Climate/Pro-Development

- Take Climate Change Pro/Against as stances
- Discuss complex issues each week from various angles
- Familiarize with common/uncommon narratives
- Role-play as people from diﬀerent social pockets


## A little Brain-Storming with Pro-Climate Stances
- Highlight how climate change impacts these areas and propose sustainable solutions or
adaptations.
- Tailor arguments to weekly themes to win more support through narratives/visuals/videos that shapes different people's perceptions
- Raise awareness from public on why being more/less climate-friendly is relevant to everybody.
- Propose Solutions to <span style="color:red">theme-related challenges</span>

## Food Systems - What do we know about them?

## Some of the hottest topics on food systems

- Plant-based diets/meat alternatives
  - Shifting towards plant-based eating and rise of lab-grown meat
- Food waste reduction
  - Strategies to minimize food waste throughout the supply chain from farm to table
- Regenerative agriculture: 
  - Farming practices that sequester carbon in soil, improve biodiversity and enhance ecosystem resilience.
- Vertical farming and urban agriculture
- Sustainable fishing: over-fishing?
- Carbon labeling of food products


## Meat Alternatives & Climate Change: The Debate


### Scientific Pros

- 30-90% fewer greenhouse gas emissions
- Significantly reduced land use
- Lower water consumption

### Scientific Cons

- Energy-intensive processing for some alternatives
- Potential monoculture issues (e.g., soy, peas)
- Nutritional profile differences


### Narrative Pros

- Innovative tech solution to climate change
- Enables "ethical consumption"
- Potential to improve global food security

### Narrative Cons

- Perception as "overly processed" food
- Cultural resistance to traditional dish substitutes
- Accusations of "greenwashing"

---

## Cutting-Edge Discussions

1. Cell-based meat: Promise vs. reality
2. Hybrid products: A transitional solution?
3. Algae and mycoprotein: The next frontier
4. Local vs. imported: Which is better?
5. Holistic assessments: Beyond just emissions
6. Policy impacts on climate benefits


## Key Takeaway

Meat alternatives offer significant potential for climate change mitigation, but challenges remain. The debate is complex, involving science, culture, and policy.

# Building Your Food Spectacle

---

## The Formula (Reminder)

::: {style="font-size: 1.8em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Fact** + **Human Story** + **Stakes** = **Spectacle**
:::

::: {style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around; margin-top: 50px;"}
::: {style="text-align: center; width: 30%; background: #ecf0f1; padding: 30px; border-radius: 10px;"}
::: {style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;"}
Weak
:::
"Beef production causes emissions"
:::

::: {style="text-align: center; width: 30%; background: #f39c12; color: white; padding: 30px; border-radius: 10px;"}
::: {style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;"}
Better
:::
"1kg beef = 60kg CO₂. 1kg tofu = 2kg."
:::

::: {style="text-align: center; width: 30%; background: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 30px; border-radius: 10px;"}
::: {style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;"}
Spectacle
:::
"Your steak emits more carbon than your car commute. You grill it on Sundays while lecturing kids to save the planet."
:::
:::

---

## PRO-CLIMATE: Make It Personal

::: {style="background: #27ae60; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 15px; font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Don't say:** "Livestock contributes to deforestation."

**Say:** "Every burger in Hong Kong has a piece of the Amazon in it. You're eating rainforest."

**Don't say:** "We should reduce meat consumption."

**Say:** "Your grandparents ate meat once a week. Now you eat it twice a day. Guess which generation is destroying the planet?"
:::

---

## PRO-DEVELOPMENT: Paint the Picture

::: {style="background: #3498db; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 15px; font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Don't say:** "Dietary choices are personal."

**Say:** "My grandmother survived famine. Now they want to tell her she can't have pork at Chinese New Year? That's not climate action — that's cultural erasure."

**Don't say:** "Traditional farming supports livelihoods."

**Say:** "Kill the cattle industry and you kill 50,000 farmers in the New Territories. Who retrains them? You? The activists?"
:::

---

## Human Story: The Sai Kung Fisherman

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Uncle Wong** has fished Hong Kong waters for 40 years. Climate activists say his catch is unsustainable.

**PRO-CLIMATE says:** "The fish stocks are collapsing. Wong is part of the problem. Buy farmed fish instead."

**PRO-DEVELOPMENT says:** "Wong's family fished here for five generations. Now some university kid with a degree tells him he's destroying the ocean? He can barely afford rent."

**The real question:** How do we protect both the ocean and Uncle Wong?
:::

## Remember: Fact-Check Your Stories

::: {style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around; margin-top: 30px;"}
::: {style="text-align: left; width: 45%; background: #27ae60; color: white; padding: 30px; border-radius: 10px;"}
::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"}
OK to Say
:::
::: {style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 15px;"}
- "Beef produces 60kg CO₂ per kg" *(FAO data)*
- "Livestock uses 80% of agricultural land" *(documented)*
- "Lab meat uses 90% less land" *(peer-reviewed studies)*
:::
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"}
NOT OK
:::
::: {style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 15px;"}
- "Meat is murder" *(moral claim, not fact)*
- "Plant-based diets cure cancer" *(exaggeration)*

# The Persuasion Playbook

---

## Rhetorical Engineering 101

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8;"}
Throughout this course, you'll learn **10 persuasion techniques** — one per week.

Each technique is grounded in **psychology and behavioral science**. Each one is used by marketers, politicians, lawyers, and anyone who needs to move people.

By Week 11, you'll have a complete **rhetorical toolkit** to engineer arguments that don't just inform — they *persuade*.

**The goal:** Make your climate arguments impossible to ignore.
:::

---

## How This Works

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Each week, at the end of class:**

1. **The Hook** — a grabby example that shows the technique in action
2. **The Science** — the psychology behind why it works
3. **You Just Saw It** — how it appeared in today's debates
4. **Next Week's Challenge** — try it yourself

**At the start of the following week:** Quick callback — did anyone try it?
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 40px; color: #e74c3c;"}
Let's begin.

# The Persuasion Playbook | Strategy #1

---

## The Open Loop

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; background: #2c3e50; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px;"}
In 1927, a psychologist noticed waiters could remember complex orders perfectly — until the bill was paid.

**Then they forgot everything instantly.**
:::

---

## The Science

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
This is the **Zeigarnik Effect**.

The brain can't let go of incomplete tasks. It allocates background processing — like a browser tab you can't close.

Netflix forces a 3-second hook before "Skip Intro" appears. Marketers call this an **open loop**: start a pattern, don't close it.

**The brain will stay to close the loop.**
:::

---

## You Just Saw It

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
The best presentations today didn't start with conclusions.

They started with a question. A tension. Something unresolved.

*"There's one fact that made me switch sides on this issue. I'll get to it."*

Did you stay to hear it? **That's the loop.**
:::

---

## Next Week's Challenge

::: {style="font-size: 2em; background: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px; text-align: center;"}
**Open a loop in your first 10 seconds.**

Don't close it until the end.
