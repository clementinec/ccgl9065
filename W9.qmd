## The Core Tension

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
| PRO-CLIMATE | PRO-DEVELOPMENT |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Rich nations caused this | National security matters |
| Moral obligation to accept refugees | Aid in origin countries |
| Climate refugees need legal status | "Climate refugee" is imprecise |
| Open doors save lives | Uncontrolled migration destabilizes |
| Global solidarity | Protect local communities first |

**This tension drives every migration and climate justice debate.**

## 0: Logistics on Final Assessment Items: Quick Q&A

- Q: What topic should I pick? From wi ?thin or outside of the in-lecture ones? Can I have one consistent theme across all three items? Can I have multiple topics covered in one assessment item?
  - A: Up to you.
- Q: What should the final reflection paper be upon?
  - A: What you think should be **our response to Climate Change at Hong Kong for 2100**.
- Q: Can we see some collage/video examples?
  - A: Refer to the 'Roadmap' document.
- Q: How do I make videos? Any templates that can be leveraged?
  - A: The quality of message delivery is valued above the quality of the video itself, i.e. script is more important than your visuals.
  - Examples that might make the video-making easier for you:
    - Voice-over on still images with some/no background music.
    - Clips from documentaries/movies/promotional videos stitched together by slogans & scripts.
  

## 1: Introduction to Climate Refugees

- **Definition of Climate Refugees**:
  - Individuals or groups compelled to leave their habitual areas due to drastic changes in their environment directly attributed to climate change.
  - Factors contributing to displacement:
    - environmental degradation, escalating sea levels, and extreme weather phenomena.

- **Known Environmental Catalysts**:
  - **Environmental Degradation**: Land erosion and loss of arable land, as seen in the Sahel region of Africa, leading to decreased food security.
  - **Sea-Level Rise**: Low-lying island nations like Kiribati facing existential threats, with some communities already relocating.
  - **Extreme Weather**: Increasing frequency and severity of hurricanes and typhoons, such as Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, displacing thousands.

## 1.1 Introduction to Climate Refugees (Conti'd)

- **Global Statistics**:
  - As of 2020, the UNHCR reports over 80 million forcibly displaced people worldwide, a number that includes refugees, internally displaced persons, and asylum-seekers.
  - Projections suggest a dramatic increase in climate refugees, potentially reaching 1.2 billion by 2050 due to intensifying climate impacts.

- **Scope of Discussion**:
  - The issue sits at the crossroads of climate change science, migration policies, and socio-political dynamics, necessitating a multidisciplinary approach to solutions.
  - Local Perspectives: Coastal cities like Jakarta facing subsidence and flooding, amplifying urban migration pressures. _What does this mean for HK?_
  - Global Perspectives: The Arctic's indigenous communities witnessing rapid environmental changes, affecting traditional lifestyles and leading to relocation.


##  2: Climate Change and Displacement Drivers

- **Direct Environmental Impacts**:
  - **Desertification**: 
    - desert landscapes expansion, e.g. encroachment of the Sahara Desert 
    - diminishing arable land and affecting agricultural livelihoods.
  - **Glacial Melt**: Regions dependent on glacial water sources like Andes, facing water scarcity as glaciers recede.
  - **<span style="color:red">Rising Sea Levels</span>**: The gradual inundation of coastal areas, exemplified by the gradual submergence of parts of Bangladesh, displacing communities.

- **Socio-economic Consequences**:
  - **Agricultural Disruption**: 
    - Changing rainfall patterns and droughts, e.g. East Africa
    - impacting food production and livelihoods.
  - **Economic Instability**: 
    - loss of homes and infrastructure, as seen in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines
    - economic downturns and displacement.
  - **Resource Competition**: Scarcity of water and other vital resources.

- **Conflict and Destabilization**:
  - **Resource Conflicts**: Competition over dwindling natural resources, like water in the Middle East
  - **Climate-Induced Migration and Conflict**: Movements of populations clashes with existing communities over resources.
  - **Destabilization and Displacement**: where climate stressors contribute to political instability, e.g. Syria

##  3: The Concept of Climate Refugees

- **Legal and Conceptual Challenges**:
  - **Non-recognition in International Law**: Not recognized in the 1951 Refugee Convention, legal gap.
  - **Definitional Ambiguities**: lines between voluntary and forced migration blurred, complicating legal definitions.

- **Human Rights and Ethical Considerations**:
  - **Right to a Safe Environment**: 
    - Recognition that safe and stable environment as a fundamental human right
    - in line with discussions around the _UN's Human Rights Council_.
  - **Protection Gaps**: Identifying the need for international frameworks that specifically address and protect individuals displaced by environmental changes.

- **Emerging Debates and Solutions**:
  - **Expanding Legal Definitions**: Amending existing conventions or creating new frameworks to include climate refugees, e.g. Global Compact on Refugees.
  - **National and Regional Policies**
  - **Ethical Imperatives**: The moral obligation of the international community, especially high-emitters.


##  4: Global Projections and Trends

- **Rising Numbers of Climate Refugees**:
  - Projections suggest escalating displacement, with climate change as a key driver.
  - World Bank's "Groundswell" report predicts up to 216 million people could be displaced by 2050:
    - 86 million in Sub-Saharan Africa, 
    - 49 million in East Asia & Pacific, 
    - 40 million in South Asian and 
    - 38 million in North & Latin America due to climate impacts.
  - Provided policy recommendations:
    - Reducing global emissions and making every effort to meet the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement.
    - Embedding internal climate migration in far-sighted green, resilient, and inclusive development planning.
    - Preparing for each phase of migration, so that internal climate migration as an adaptation strategy can result in positive development outcomes.
    - Investing in better understanding of the drivers of internal climate migration to inform well-targeted policies.

## Slide 4.1: Hotspots of Global Projections
- **Geographical Hotspots**:
  - **Sub-Saharan Africa**: 
    - Vulnerable due to a combination of high exposure to climate impacts and low adaptive capacity. 
    - Countries like Nigeria and Sudan are already witnessing internal displacement due to desertification and flooding.
  - **South Asia**: 
    - Densely populated regions, including coastal areas of India and Bangladesh
    - at significant risk from cyclones, flooding, and sea-level rise
  - **Small Island Developing States (SIDS)**: 
    - Nations such as Fiji, Maldives, and Tuvalu face existential threats from sea-level rise

- **Impact on Urbanization**:
  - **Migration to Cities**: e.g. Dhaka (Bangladesh) 
    - Larger cities experiencing significant influxes of climate migrants
    - exacerbating urban challenges such as housing and infrastructure.
  - **Urban Vulnerability**: e.g. Miami and Jakarta
    - Coastal cities' own climate risks + sea-level rise and flooding, 
    - interplay between migration and urban resilience.

##  5: Socio-economic Impacts of Climate Migration

  - **Economic Strains**: 
    - Agricultural productivity lost in rural areas can lead to reduced incomes and increased poverty
    - e.g. Ethiopian communities affected by recurring droughts.
  - **Demographic Shifts**: 
    - The out-migration of working-age individuals leaves behind an aging population, 
    - social fabric and community support systems changed
    - parts of rural Latin America/northeastern China.

- **Challenges for Host Communities**:
  - **Resource Pressure**: 
    - Influxes of migrants can strain local resources and services
    - evident in cities like Beirut as significant population increase due to refugees from neighboring conflict zones.
  - **Integration and Social Cohesion**: 
    - integrating migrants into new communities while maintaining social cohesion
    - asylum crisis and social welfare: Murder of Marrisa Shen (2017)

## 5.1 Socio-economic Impacts of Climate Migration (Cont'd)

## PRO-CLIMATE: Make It Personal

::: {style="background: #27ae60; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 15px; font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Don't say:** "Rich nations should accept climate refugees."

**Say:** "Europe industrialized on coal. America grew rich on oil. Now a farmer in the Mekong Delta loses his home because the sea rose. You made his world flood — and you want to close the door?"

**Don't say:** "Climate displacement is a human rights issue."

**Say:** "Kiribati is sinking. The entire country will disappear. 120,000 people with nowhere to go. The UN says they're not refugees because water, not war, took their home."
:::

## PRO-DEVELOPMENT: Paint the Picture

::: {style="background: #3498db; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 15px; font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Don't say:** "Uncontrolled migration causes instability."

**Say:** "In 2015, one million refugees entered Germany. Merkel said 'Wir schaffen das.' Now AfD is the second-largest party. Open borders created closed minds."

**Don't say:** "We should help in origin countries."

**Say:** "Every dollar spent resettling one refugee in Hong Kong could support 100 people in a camp closer to home. Math isn't cruel — misallocated compassion is."

## Human Story: The Carteret Islands

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**The Carteret Islanders** in Papua New Guinea were the world's first official climate refugees. Rising seas contaminated their freshwater. Crops failed. Their home became unlivable.

**PRO-CLIMATE says:** "They did nothing to cause this. Their carbon footprint is zero. Yet they pay for our emissions with their homeland."

**PRO-DEVELOPMENT says:** "Resettling 3,000 people is manageable. Resettling 1.2 billion is a fantasy. We need to be honest about what's possible."

**The real question:** Who decides who gets to be a refugee — and who gets to stay home?
:::

# The Persuasion Playbook | Strategy #8

---

## The Invisible Bandwagon

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; background: #2c3e50; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px;"}
Researchers changed one line in a tax notice:

*"9 out of 10 people in your area pay their taxes on time."*

**Compliance jumped 15%.**

Not moral appeal. Not threats. Just: *you're the weird one if you don't.*
:::

---

## The Science

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
This is **Social Proof** + **Normative Messaging**.

But the key is: **local and specific**.

- "Most people" → weak
- "Most people in your building" → strong
- "Most people in your building with kids your age" → irresistible

**The more similar the reference group, the more powerful the pull.**
:::

---

## You Just Saw It

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
The best arguments today didn't say "people care about climate."

They said:

*"Engineers at HKU are already shifting their research priorities."*

A bandwagon that didn't exist until you named it.

## Next Week's Challenge

::: {style="font-size: 2em; background: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px; text-align: center;"}
**Create a bandwagon for your argument.**

Make it local. Make it specific. Make them the outlier if they disagree.
