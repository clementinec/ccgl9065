## 1: Introduction to Climate Refugees

- **Definition of Climate Refugees**:
  - Individuals or groups compelled to leave their habitual areas due to drastic changes in their environment directly attributed to climate change.
  - Factors contributing to displacement:
    - environmental degradation, escalating sea levels, and extreme weather phenomena.

- **Known Environmental Catalysts**:
  - **Environmental Degradation**: Land erosion and loss of arable land, as seen in the Sahel region of Africa, leading to decreased food security.
  - **Sea-Level Rise**: Low-lying island nations like Kiribati facing existential threats, with some communities already relocating.
  - **Extreme Weather**: Increasing frequency and severity of hurricanes and typhoons, such as Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, displacing thousands.

## 1.1 Introduction to Climate Refugees (Conti'd)

- **Global Statistics**:
  - As of 2020, the UNHCR reports over 80 million forcibly displaced people worldwide, a number that includes refugees, internally displaced persons, and asylum-seekers.
  - Projections suggest a dramatic increase in climate refugees, potentially reaching 1.2 billion by 2050 due to intensifying climate impacts.

- **Scope of Discussion**:
  - The issue sits at the crossroads of climate change science, migration policies, and socio-political dynamics, necessitating a multidisciplinary approach to solutions.
  - Local Perspectives: Coastal cities like Jakarta facing subsidence and flooding, amplifying urban migration pressures. _What does this mean for HK?_
  - Global Perspectives: The Arctic's indigenous communities witnessing rapid environmental changes, affecting traditional lifestyles and leading to relocation.
