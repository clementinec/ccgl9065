## 1: Introduction to the Modern Space Race
- Renewed interest in space:
  - New players: Private companies, billionaires
  - Goals: Mars colonization, space tourism
- Dual narrative:
  - Progress vs. escapism concerns

## Space Race

## 2: Historical Context - The Original Space Race
- US vs. USSR competition:
  - Sputnik launch (1957)
  - Moon landing (1969)
- Symbolized:
  - National pride
  - Technological superiority

::: {.notes}
The space race was a 20th Century struggle between two nation-states, the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States (US). The pursuit for both was the domination of space flight technologies. The competition began on 2 August 1955, when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement of their similar intent to launch artificial satellites.

The space race between the United States (US) and the Soviet Union (USSR) was a remarkable time in history with many far-reaching achievements in science, space exploration, and technology. This timeline shows the twenty-year competition between the two nations.

## 3: Historical vs. Modern Space Race
- Then: Government-led
  - Apollo program budget: ~$25.4 billion (~$150 billion in today's dollars)
  - Eugene Cernan was the last person to walk on the moon moon in 1972.
  - Communication, medical and technological advancements
  - 'thaw' in cold war led to cooperation between two nations

::: {.notes}
On 12 September 1962, President John F. Kennedy delivered a speech to a large crowd gathered at the Rice Stadium in Houston, Texas. The speech called for an ambitious space exploration programme that included not just missions to put astronauts on the Moon, but various other space projects such as communications and weather satellites. The quotation "We choose to go to the Moon" is remembered as the tagline from the speech. The US would succeed in this mission eight years later, but Kennedy would not be around to see it. He was assassinated two years later in Dallas, Texas on 22 November 1963. 

How it was started: 
Following the Second World War, the United States and the Soviet Union competed to see who had the best technology in space. This included events such as the first satellite to orbit Earth, the first human-crewed spacecraft and the first person to walk on the Moon. The space race was considered vital by the two nations as it showed the world which country had the superior scientific, economic and political systems.

  - Does not get publicized on how this can be reduced as space explorations goes full commercial as tourism
- Comparison:
  - A single space shuttle launch = ~23 hours of 747 air travel emissions

## 6: Costs of Space Exploration
- Financials:
  - NASA’s Mars Perseverance Rover mission cost: ~$2.7 billion
- Debate:
  - Allocation towards terrestrial vs. space issues

## 6.1 Space Tourism Going Private
- **Space X**: 
  - Drastically reduced cost of space launch with Falcon rockets
  - Avg. cost per launch now around $62 million (contrast to $100 to $500 million prior to Falcon)
- Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic
  - Suborbital space tourism
  - Ticket around $250,000 per passenger

## 7: Unintended Benefits of Space Exploration
- Technological spinoffs:
  - GPS technology, initially for military/naval use
  - Memory foam, developed for aircraft cushions
- Anecdote:
  - Camera phones using tech developed for space imaging

## 8: The Debate on Extraterrestrial Life
- Search efforts:
  - Mars rovers searching for microbial life signs
- Philosophical implication:
  - "Are we alone?" A question driving human curiosity

## 9: Ethical Considerations of Space Colonization
- Terraforming Mars:
  - Ethical debate on transforming another planet
- Protecting potential life:
  - Planetary protection protocols to avoid contamination

## 10: The "Escape Plan" Mentality
- Critique:
  - Viewing space as an "escape" from Earth's issues
- Anecdote:
  - Stephen Hawking's warning about Earth's fragility and the need for an alternative
- Interesting Pop Culture/Sci-Fi Reference: The Wandering Earth
