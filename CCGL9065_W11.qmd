## 1: Introduction to the Modern Space Race
- Renewed interest in space:
  - New players: Private companies, billionaires
  - Goals: Mars colonization, space tourism
- Dual narrative:
  - Progress vs. escapism concerns

## Space Race
![](https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/1400/fd469f52676089.591915a90fbf8.jpg)

## 2: Historical Context - The Original Space Race
- US vs. USSR competition:
  - Sputnik launch (1957)
  - Moon landing (1969)
- Symbolized:
  - National pride
  - Technological superiority

::: {.notes}
The space race was a 20th Century struggle between two nation-states, the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States (US). The pursuit for both was the domination of space flight technologies. The competition began on 2 August 1955, when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement of their similar intent to launch artificial satellites.

The space race between the United States (US) and the Soviet Union (USSR) was a remarkable time in history with many far-reaching achievements in science, space exploration, and technology. This timeline shows the twenty-year competition between the two nations.

## 3: Historical vs. Modern Space Race
- Then: Government-led
  - Apollo program budget: ~$25.4 billion (~$150 billion in today's dollars)
  - Eugene Cernan was the last person to walk on the moon moon in 1972.
  - Communication, medical and technological advancements
  - 'thaw' in cold war led to cooperation between two nations

::: {.notes}
On 12 September 1962, President John F. Kennedy delivered a speech to a large crowd gathered at the Rice Stadium in Houston, Texas. The speech called for an ambitious space exploration programme that included not just missions to put astronauts on the Moon, but various other space projects such as communications and weather satellites. The quotation "We choose to go to the Moon" is remembered as the tagline from the speech. The US would succeed in this mission eight years later, but Kennedy would not be around to see it. He was assassinated two years later in Dallas, Texas on 22 November 1963. 

How it was started: 
Following the Second World War, the United States and the Soviet Union competed to see who had the best technology in space. This included events such as the first satellite to orbit Earth, the first human-crewed spacecraft and the first person to walk on the Moon. The space race was considered vital by the two nations as it showed the world which country had the superior scientific, economic and political systems.

- Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic
  - Suborbital space tourism
  - Ticket around $250,000 per passenger

## 7: Unintended Benefits of Space Exploration

# Building Your Space Spectacle

## The Formula (Reminder)

::: {style="font-size: 1.8em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Fact** + **Human Story** + **Stakes** = **Spectacle**
:::

::: {style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around; margin-top: 50px;"}
::: {style="text-align: center; width: 30%; background: #ecf0f1; padding: 30px; border-radius: 10px;"}
::: {style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;"}
Weak
:::
"Space exploration costs money"

Spectacle
:::
"Elon Musk's rocket company is worth more than the entire climate adaptation budget of the 50 poorest countries combined."
:::

## PRO-CLIMATE: Make It Personal

::: {style="background: #27ae60; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 15px; font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Don't say:** "Space exploration wastes resources."

**Say:** "Jeff Bezos spent $5.5 billion on 11 minutes in space. That's more than the entire annual budget for UNICEF clean water programs. You're watching billionaires play astronaut while children die of thirst."

**Don't say:** "We should focus on Earth."

**Say:** "Mars has no oxygen, no water, no life. Earth has all three — and we're destroying them. The 'backup planet' fantasy is just rich people planning their escape."
:::

---

## PRO-DEVELOPMENT: Paint the Picture

::: {style="background: #3498db; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 15px; font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Don't say:** "Space technology has spinoffs."

**Say:** "GPS, weather satellites, fire detection from orbit — space technology saves more lives per year than all climate NGOs combined. You want to cut that?"

**Don't say:** "Humans need a backup planet."

**Say:** "The dinosaurs didn't have a space program. They're extinct. One asteroid and everything we've built — every symphony, every cure, every child's laugh — gone forever. Space isn't escape. It's insurance."
:::

---

## Human Story: The Overview Effect

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Every astronaut** who sees Earth from space reports the same thing: profound awe at Earth's fragility and unity. Borders disappear. The atmosphere looks impossibly thin.

**PRO-CLIMATE says:** "That's the point! They realize Earth is all we have. Stop going to space — start protecting home."

**PRO-DEVELOPMENT says:** "That's also the point! Only by going to space do we truly understand Earth. The environmental movement was born from the Apollo 8 'Earthrise' photo."

**The real question:** Does space exploration wake us up to Earth's fragility — or distract us from saving it?
:::

## Remember: Fact-Check Your Stories

::: {style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around; margin-top: 30px;"}
::: {style="text-align: left; width: 45%; background: #27ae60; color: white; padding: 30px; border-radius: 10px;"}

OK to Say
:::
::: {style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 15px;"}
- "One rocket launch = 300 tons CO₂" *(documented)*
- "SpaceX valuation >$100 billion" *(financial records)*
- "500,000+ debris pieces in orbit" *(ESA tracking)*

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"}
NOT OK
:::
::: {style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 15px;"}
- "Billionaires don't care about Earth" *(mind-reading)*
- "Space will save humanity" *(unfounded prophecy)*
- "Rockets are the main cause of emissions" *(false — tiny %)*

## 20. Change of Plan with role-finding this week

### Experts/Influencers on:
- Space Exploration Advocacy versus
- Vowing to pause space exploration for more important issues like climate change

### General Public as:
1. Educators and academics from STEM
2. Policy makers and government officials
3. Business leaders and entrepreneurs in energy sector
4. Social scientists and ethicists 
5. Tech industry professionals
6. Self-defined (Pick as you wish)

## 21. Wrapping up CCGL9065
- Foster critical thinking
- We have one topic
  - Step 1: From which we picked two different sides
  - Step 2: From each sides there are a multitude of angles of expression
      - What left a mark on your perception?
      - <span style= "color: red">And how can you influence other people with these experience?</span>

## Practical Question: Essay-Writing Clarification

- **YOUR** response to climate change with HK 2100 in mind
- "story" not to be confused with "fiction"
  - story-telling $≠$ story-creation
- **Objective**: Write a reflective essay (750 words max) that uses a narrative to propose a realistic climate change solution.
- **Grading criteria:**
  - address the task aka provide an individual response in writing
  - show engagement of your topic w/ overarching climate change theme
  - present clear, logical argument from various perspectives, including counter-evidence if any
  - coherent structure with clear call of action and conclusion, proper paragraphing, minimal language errors  
- **Final Note**: The essay and visual should not only reflect academic insights but also aim to inspire broader awareness and action on climate change.

# The Persuasion Playbook | Strategy #10 (Final)

---

## The Self-Persuasion Trick

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; background: #2c3e50; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px;"}
People paid **$1** to lie about a boring task later *believed the task was interesting*.

People paid **$20** didn't change their beliefs.

**Why?**
:::

---

## The Science

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
This is **Cognitive Dissonance** (Festinger, 1957).

$1 wasn't enough justification, so the brain invented one: *"I must have actually liked it."*

Cults don't brainwash. They get you to **do things**.

Then your brain rewrites the story.

**Behavior first. Belief follows.**
:::

---

## You Just Saw It

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
The most powerful moments this semester weren't when someone *told* you what to think.

They were when someone asked you to **do something**:

*"Raise your hand if you've ever felt hopeless about climate."*

Now you've publicly identified. Your brain needs to reconcile that.
:::

---

## The Final Challenge

::: {style="font-size: 2em; background: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px; text-align: center;"}
**Don't tell them the conclusion.**

Make them say it. Make them do something.

**They'll persuade themselves.**
