*The body believes what the mind resists.*

**Anyone try it?** Did you make your audience physically uncomfortable — on purpose?

# The Persuasion Playbook | Strategy #4

## The Anchoring Trap

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; background: #2c3e50; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px;"}
Realtors show you a terrible, overpriced house **first**.

The second house — still overpriced — looks reasonable.

**You don't evaluate houses. You evaluate differences from the anchor.**

## The Science

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
This is **Anchoring** (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).

The first number you hear distorts all subsequent judgment — even when it's obviously irrelevant.

In experiments, people estimated higher values after spinning a **random wheel** with higher numbers.

**The brain cannot ignore the anchor.**

## You Just Saw It

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
When someone opened with an extreme number:

*"AI could consume 30% of global electricity by 2040. Even the conservative estimate is 12%."*

Now 12% sounds reasonable. But 12% is still catastrophic.

**The anchor did its job.**

## Next Week's Challenge

::: {style="font-size: 2em; background: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px; text-align: center;"}
**Lead with the extreme. Then offer the "reasonable" version.**

Set the anchor before they do.
