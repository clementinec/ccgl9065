    "text": "Climate Change is the single greatest challenge of our generation. The quality of life of future generations will depend on the decisions we make, and how we design our planet today. Our powerful human imagination has enabled us to produce more mobile devices than people, build highways, immense cities, alter soils, crop genetic materials, redirect rivers, melt glaciers, design the chemistry of the atmosphere and the oceans, manufacture enough weapons to destroy humankind several times over. The ways humankind has lived and acted over the past centuries embody the idea that the earth has an unlimited supply of resources and that nature is there for humans to take and exploit. This must change.\nPrompted by Einstein’s well-known quote that “we cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used to create them,” this course will guide students into exploring a series of both mainstream and more controversial responses to climate change. We will criticise, debate, role play and imagine new narratives, models and metrics of success and ultimately design and advocate for a future we want. We will use Hong Kong 2100 as the theater of this speculative design work to build a better response to climate change. The outcome of the course will be an interactive public Art & Science exhibition, with illustrations, short-essays and discussions with strangers so that we can share our work and spark further innovation.\n\n\n\nTime: Wednesdays, 12:30-14:20\nLocation: LE2\nSylalbus\n\n\n\n\nStarter-kit: Personal Research Doc on Notion\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 1\nWeek 2"

It’s estimated that producing a single pair of jeans can require thousands of liters of water.\nThe “wash” effect, popular in many jeans, is achieved through various techniques such as stone washing or acid washing, which further increases water usage."

This results in significant waste, as consumers discard old jeans for new trends.\nLandfills are increasingly burdened by textile waste, including denim, which can take decades to decompose due to its synthetic blend components.\n\nMicrofibers and Pollution:\n\nDuring washing, denim, like other textiles, releases microfibers that can pass through wastewater treatment plants and contribute to oceanic and freshwater microplastic pollution."

It can also be labor-intensive and may not always result in products that meet consumer needs or preferences, potentially leading to items that are ultimately discarded."
