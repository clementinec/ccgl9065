    "text": "What’s the Difference between Climate and Weather?\nHeading out for a walk on a chilly spring morning, you notice misty clouds on the hills in the distance. You’re feeling eager for summer to arrive, but the hillsides are just beginning to green up after the end of winter. You wonder, “Is it cooler than usual this spring? I think I’m usually wearing shorts by this time of year.” Thinking about the weather, you recognize what you’re really concerned about is if it will rain on your barbecue this weekend…\nThese are some of the everyday thoughts people have about weather and climate. Though climate and weather are closely related, they aren’t the same thing.\n\nWhether there is mist on the mountains on a given morning is a weather question. Whether such misty mornings are common or unusual is a climate question. Photo by Betsy Youngman."

People describe weather in terms of temperature, precipitation, humidity, cloudiness, wind, and other variables. Weather can vary from minute to minute and location to location. For instance, it’s not unusual for a place to have a cloudy, wet morning that gives way to a sunny afternoon, or for rain to fall on one side of a town, but not the other. In order to make sense, descriptions of weather always include both time and location.\n\nExample of weather"

In the United States, daily observations at stations that meet specified criteria, methodically collected by volunteer observers and automated weather stations, are used to document our weather and climate. One volunteer weather observer program in the United States is the Cooperative Observer Program (COOP).\nThis program, which includes more than 11,000 stations, is key to obtaining accurate observations across the country. Started in 1890, the COOP network now spans all corners of our nation: from mountaintops to meadows, urban to rural regions, and from seashores to suburbs.\nInternationally this program also covers a great number of weather stations that are collectively recorded on NOAA.gov from the United States."

It’s estimated that producing a single pair of jeans can require thousands of liters of water.\nThe “wash” effect, popular in many jeans, is achieved through various techniques such as stone washing or acid washing, which further increases water usage."

    "text": "3: Historical vs. Modern Space Race\n\nThen: Government-led\n\nApollo program budget: ~$25.4 billion (~$150 billion in today’s dollars)\nEugene Cernan was the last person to walk on the moon moon in 1972.\nCommunication, medical and technological advancements\n‘thaw’ in cold war led to cooperation between two nations\n\n\n\nOn 12 September 1962, President John F. Kennedy delivered a speech to a large crowd gathered at the Rice Stadium in Houston, Texas. The speech called for an ambitious space exploration programme that included not just missions to put astronauts on the Moon, but various other space projects such as communications and weather satellites. The quotation “We choose to go to the Moon” is remembered as the tagline from the speech. The US would succeed in this mission eight years later, but Kennedy would not be around to see it. He was assassinated two years later in Dallas, Texas on 22 November 1963.\nHow it was started: Following the Second World War, the United States and the Soviet Union competed to see who had the best technology in space. This included events such as the first satellite to orbit Earth, the first human-crewed spacecraft and the first person to walk on the Moon. The space race was considered vital by the two nations as it showed the world which country had the superior scientific, economic and political systems.\n\n\nNow: Private sector involvement\n\nSpaceX valuation: Over $100 billion as of 2021\nCompetitors catching up but not fast enough"

Urgency and emotional appeals can override caution patterns.\n\n\nIncremental escalation\nEach response becomes part of the context. Gradual shifts are harder for the model to “notice” than sudden jumps.\n\n\n\nThe core insight: None of this is persuasion. The AI has no mind to persuade. You’re finding edges in a statistical system.\n\n\nWhat to Document\n\nExact prompt you used\nStrategy employed\nPersona or framing you adopted\nIf success: screenshot the result\nIf failure: why you think it held\n\n\n\nSynthesis Discussion Questions\n\nWhich strategies worked?

We will criticise, debate, role play and imagine new narratives, models and metrics of success — and ultimately design and advocate for a future we want.\nWe use Hong Kong 2100 as the theater of this speculative design work.
