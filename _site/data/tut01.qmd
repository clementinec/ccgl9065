## Climate Data Primer

![Example of a climate data table showing daily maximum and minimum temperature, as well as precipitation, for a weather station near Old Faithful, Wyoming.](https://www.climate.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width_620_original_image/public/2021-07/DatasetGallery_Daily-Temperature-and-Precipitation-Reports-Table_thumb_16x9_0.png?itok=YRiE0dCJ){width=600}

## Why does climate data matter? Lots of people check climate data to help them make decisions:

- Folks who are planning outdoor events check _climate normals data_ to help them choose a date when they can expect pleasant weather.
- Ranchers, farmers, and outdoor-recreation businesses regularly _monitor drought conditions_ to see if the environment has sufficient water for plants and animals.
- Weather enthusiasts like to explore _extreme storms and record-setting events_.
- People who live near the coast consider how _sea level rise_ might affect them.
- Students often consider the relationship between global temperature and greenhouse gases.
- Water companies check _precipitation and river levels_ to monitor water supplies.

## What's the Difference between Climate and Weather?
Heading out for a walk on a chilly spring morning, you notice misty clouds on the hills in the distance. You're feeling eager for summer to arrive, but the hillsides are just beginning to green up after the end of winter. You wonder, “Is it cooler than usual this spring? I think I'm usually wearing shorts by this time of year.” Thinking about the weather, you recognize what you're really concerned about is if it will rain on your barbecue this weekend…

These are some of the everyday thoughts people have about weather and climate. Though climate and weather are closely related, they aren't the same thing.

![Whether there is mist on the mountains on a given morning is a weather question. Whether such misty mornings are common or unusual is a climate question.

## Compare Weather and Climate:

### On Weather
The short-term state of the atmosphere—in the past, present, or future—is weather. People describe weather in terms of temperature, precipitation, humidity, cloudiness, wind, and other variables. Weather can vary from minute to minute and location to location. For instance, it's not unusual for a place to have a cloudy, wet morning that gives way to a sunny afternoon, or for rain to fall on one side of a town, but not the other. In order to make sense, descriptions of weather always include both time and location.

![Example of weather](https://www.climate.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width_620_alternate_image/public/RTMA_Jun20-3x2_620.png?itok=D2_dWAqR){width=600}

---

### On Climate
Climate is a description of the **long-term pattern of weather** conditions at a location. The expression “long-term” usually means 30 years or more: climate scientists have agreed that 30 years is a good length of time to establish what the usual range of conditions are at a given location throughout the year. 

![Example of Climate](https://www.climate.gov/sites/default/files/styles/inline_all/public/averagetemp-June-1981-2010-cmb--1000x690--0000-06-00.jpg?itok=5P9vrr0M){width=800}

### Weather vs. Climate

**Climate is what you expect; weather is what you get.**
- Weather tells you what to wear each day; climate tells you what to have in your closet.
- Weather is the chocolate caramel truffle, climate is the whole box of chocolates.

## How Weather Observations Become Climate Data

By the time 30 years of observations have been collected, the scattering of individual dots (weather) becomes a broad swath that marks our the range of normal daytime high temperatures (climate).

## Value of long-term record-keeping

## How do weather observations become climate data?
Observations of Weather are the Foundation of Climate Products

![Observation locations across the United States before becoming climate data: Cooperative Observers Program (COOP) Stations in the lower 48 states.

## Weather Station Observations
Around the globe, millions of weather observations are recorded each day, by both human observers and automated instruments. In the United States, daily observations at stations that meet specified criteria, methodically collected by volunteer observers and automated weather stations, are used to document our weather and climate. One volunteer weather observer program in the United States is the <span style="color:red">**Cooperative Observer Program (COOP)**</span>. 

This program, which includes more than 11,000 stations, is key to obtaining accurate observations across the country. Started in 1890, the COOP network now spans all corners of our nation: from mountaintops to meadows, urban to rural regions, and from seashores to suburbs. 

**Internationally** this program also covers a great number of weather stations that are collectively recorded on NOAA.gov from the United States.

## Monitoring Weather at the Surface
Over time, scientific organizations began establishing networks of weather-observing stations across the United States and around the world. This includes thousands of US official weather stations, and many more volunteer observers who record weather data every day:

- 11,700 Cooperative Observer (COOP) weather stations
- 122 National Weather Service (NWS) Offices
- 840 automated stations at airports—maintained by the Federal Aviation Association (FAA)
- 900+ Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS)
- 1,100 additional Automated Weather Observing Stations (AWOS)

## Essential Climate Variables (ECVs)
ECVs were selected based upon their feasibility, relevance, and cost-effectiveness, as well as their reliability and consistency. The variables are grouped into three categories: atmospheric (air), terrestrial (land), and oceanic (ocean). For all categories, sensors record both in-situ (in place) and remote measurements.

- Air Temperature
- Relative Humidity
- Level of Percipitation
- Surface Temperature
- Phytoplankton
- Sea Ice
- Sea state, etc.


## Using Climate Data
Doesn't have to be a scientist to use climate data, so long as you try to answer these following 10 questions:

1. Have tropical storms or hurricanes ever impacted your state?
2. Is your region currently experiencing drought? If so, is it likely to continue?
3. How much has atmospheric carbon dioxide (or another greenhouse gas) increased since you were born?
4. Which parts of Washington, D.C. will be inundated (covered with water) if sea level rises by 3 feet?
5. What are the chances that the next season will be warmer or cooler than usual?
6. By what average distance has sea level been rising each year since 1993?
7. What is the highest temperature ever recorded in your state? Where and when did it occur?
8. Which parts (if any) of the United States are experiencing flood conditions along the rivers?
9. Are there any known climate or weather hazards for your area for the next 3 to 14 days?
10. What date did volunteer Cooperative Observers begin recording weather observations in your state?
