# Course Overview

## What This Course Is About

This is **not** a science course. This is a course about **narratives, choices, and power**.

Climate science has been settled for decades. Scientists have been warning us for 50+ years. Yet meaningful action remains elusive. Why?

**The uncomfortable truth:** Facts don't change minds. Stories do.

This course teaches you how to **stitch facts together with narratives** — arguments that are factual, but told in ways that leave bigger impressions. The goal: Turn data into **spectacles** that move people to action.

## Course Format

- **When:** Wednesdays, 15:00–16:50
- **Where:** LE4
- **Structure:** 50 min lecture + 50 min activity
- **Assessment:** Participation + Midterm + Final Portfolio

## How Each Week Works

Every week = a **new battlefield** of arguments. A new topic. New facts. New angles of attack.

### The Weekly Rhythm

| First 50 min (Lecture) | Second 50 min (Activity) |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| I present the facts | You share your homework |
| I present the stakes | You build group arguments |
| I give both sides ammunition | You present to the class |
| | You debate the other side |

### Your Tools

**Your Notion Page (Personal Portfolio)**

- Add research each week
- Grows all semester
- Becomes your final project foundation
- You own it

**Slack Battlefield Channels**

- Weekly debate channels (e.g., `#w1-battlefield-ai`)
- Share your best findings
- Discuss with classmates
- Everyone can see and learn from each other

### The Weekly Flow

1. **Before class:** Research the topic → Add to your Notion page
2. **Post to Slack:** Share your best fact/story to the battlefield channel
3. **In class (first half):** I present ammunition for both sides
4. **In class (second half):** Groups synthesize, present, debate
5. **After class:** Best arguments get curated into the Channel Canvas

### No Fixed Groups

You're not locked into a position or group. Week 1 you might argue PRO-AI. Week 2 you might switch to PRO-Climate. **Drift around. Explore different angles.** The goal is to understand all sides.

# Today's Topic: AI & Climate

## The AI Energy Crisis

Artificial Intelligence is rapidly becoming one of the largest energy consumers on the planet.

### Key Statistics (2024–2030)

| Metric | 2024 | 2030 (Projected) |
|--------|-----:|----------------:|
| Global Data Centers | 415 TWh | 945 TWh |
| US Data Centers | 183 TWh | 426 TWh |
| AI Servers (US only) | 53–76 TWh | 165–326 TWh |

*Source: IEA Energy and AI Report*

### Comparisons That Matter

- **US data centers** use more electricity than Pakistan (240 million people)
- **Training one large AI model** = lifetime emissions of 5 cars
- **AI's carbon footprint (2025):** 32–80 million tons CO₂
- **Water consumed:** 312–765 billion liters

### Where Does AI Get Its Power?

US Data Centers power mix (2024):

- Natural Gas: 40%+
- Renewables: 24%
- Nuclear: 20%
- Coal: 15%

**Most AI runs on fossil fuels.**

## Countries Retreating from Climate Commitments

| Country | Change |
|---------|--------|
| **USA** | Withdrew from Paris Agreement; no federal net-zero target |
| **Turkey** | Pushed net-zero from 2053 → 2070; coal production up 18% |
| **Poland** | Extended net-zero from 2050 → 2060; cut renewable subsidies 35% |
| **Indonesia** | Renewable targets cut from 23% → 18%; extended coal permits |

The pattern: **Short-term economic interests beat long-term climate action. Every time.**

# The Debate Framework

## Two Worldviews

### PRO-AI (Pro-Development)

**Core belief:** Progress is the solution, not the problem.

**Arguments:**

1. AI optimizes everything — energy grids, supply chains, agriculture
2. Economic growth lifts people out of poverty
3. Renewables need AI to manage intermittent power
4. The IEA says AI could reduce emissions by ~5% by 2035
5. Slowing down = falling behind China

**Identity:** Pragmatists. Builders. Realists.

### PRO-US (Pro-Human)

**Core belief:** We can't tech our way out of a crisis caused by tech.

**Arguments:**

1. AI's energy costs are real and growing — benefits are theoretical
2. We already have solutions — policy, behavior change, existing tech
3. The poor pay the price — climate impacts hit the vulnerable
4. Tech companies have no accountability — "green AI" while burning coal
5. Every delay = lives lost

**Identity:** Humanists. Protectors. Truth-tellers.

# How to Build a Story

## The Formula

$$\text{Fact} + \text{Human Story} + \text{Stakes} = \text{Spectacle}$$

| Level | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **Weak** | "AI uses a lot of energy" |
| **Better** | "AI uses more electricity than Pakistan" |
| **Spectacle** | "Your ChatGPT query costs a town its drinking water" |

## PRO-US: Stories That Scare

### The Human Cost

- A Rice University student took their own life — the pressure of competing with AI, feeling replaceable, was part of their struggle.
- "AI is taking your job" — not in 10 years, but **now**. Customer service, coding, writing, design.

### The Corporate Villain

- Big Tech is profiting off job opportunities that **went to PEOPLE** — and replacing them with algorithms.
- *"Every time you cheer for AI, you're voting to make yourself obsolete."*

### The Exploitation Angle

- Data centers are built in poor communities. They get the pollution. Tech workers get the raises.
- "Green AI" is marketing. The coal plants are real.

### Make It Personal

| Don't Say | Say |
|-----------|-----|
| "AI contributes to carbon emissions" | "Your kid's asthma inhaler? That's because a data center needed to generate your meme." |
| "Automation displaces workers" | "Your dad worked 30 years in logistics. ChatGPT just made him obsolete. And you're celebrating?" |

## PRO-AI: Stories That Inspire

### The Productivity Revolution

- A single person can now do what took a team of 10
- Students in developing countries access world-class tutoring — for free
- Small businesses compete with giants because AI levels the playing field

### The Innovation Hope

- AI is discovering new materials for solar panels, optimizing wind farms, predicting floods
- "The same technology that causes problems can solve them — if we invest"

### The Realism Card

- "China isn't slowing down. Do you want zero influence on how AI develops?"
- Stopping AI won't bring jobs back. Adapting will create new ones.

### Paint the Picture

| Don't Say | Say |
|-----------|-----|
| "AI improves efficiency" | "A farmer in Kenya used AI to diagnose her crop disease in 30 seconds. Her village didn't starve." |
| "We need technological progress" | "My grandmother was diagnosed with cancer. AI caught it 6 months earlier than her doctor would have. She's alive because of that." |

## The Key Insight

You're not lying. You're **selecting** which truths to emphasize. You're **framing** facts inside stories people can feel.

This is how every debate is won — climate, politics, business, life.

**Your audience doesn't remember data. They remember how you made them feel.**

Angry. Hopeful. Scared. Inspired. That's the spectacle.

## But Here's the Rule: Every Story Must Be Fact-Checkable

This is the line between **persuasion** and **propaganda**.

### Persuasion (OK)

- Selecting **real** facts
- Framing **verified** stories
- Emphasizing **documented** impacts
- Using **sourced** statistics
- Making real data **vivid**

### Propaganda (NOT OK)

- Inventing stories
- Fabricating statistics
- Making up "examples"
- Exaggerating beyond evidence
- Claiming things you can't verify

### The Test

Before you use a story, ask:

1. **Can I cite a source?** (news article, study, report)
2. **Could someone fact-check this?** (and find it's true)
3. **Am I framing reality or inventing it?**

**If you can't answer YES to all three — don't use it.**

### Example: The Rice University Story

- **Fact-checkable:** Yes — this was reported in news media.
- **Verifiable:** The student's struggles with AI pressure were documented.
- **Framing:** We're emphasizing a real case to illustrate broader concerns.
- **NOT OK:** Claiming "hundreds of students have died because of AI" without evidence.

*The story is powerful because it's real — not because we invented it.*

**Emotions need reality backing them. Your job: Find the real stories that make people feel. Not invent them.**

# Today's Activity

## Instructions

### Step 1: Divide Into Groups

- **Left side of room:** PRO-AI (Development)
- **Right side of room:** PRO-US (Human)

### Step 2: Create Your Persona (5 min)

**PRO-AI personas:**

- Tech CEO building "green AI"
- Economist focused on growth
- Developing-nation minister needing energy
- Engineer optimizing power grids

**PRO-US personas:**

- Climate activist
- Community organizer in a polluted town
- Public health researcher
- Indigenous rights advocate

**Ask yourself:** Who am I? What's my story? What do I fear losing?

### Step 3: Group Discussion (10 min)

Prepare **3 key arguments** for your side:

1. **Energy**: Is AI's cost justified?
2. **Solutions vs. Distractions**: Does tech help or delay action?
3. **Who pays?**: Who benefits, who suffers?

**Remember:** Don't just list facts. Tell a story. Make it emotional.

### Step 4: Presentations (5 min each side)

Present your arguments. Make your audience *feel* something.

# Key Takeaways

1. **Science is necessary but not sufficient** — narratives drive action
2. **AI is accelerating the crisis** — real costs, speculative benefits
3. **Countries are retreating** — short-term wins over long-term survival
4. **Your job this semester:** Argue all sides. Understand all sides. Build better stories.
