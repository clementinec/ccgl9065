## Next Steps
1. **W5 & W8:** Decision needed on PDF conversion
   - Option A: Convert PDFs to QMD format, then enhance
   - Option B: Leave as PDFs, create supplementary QMD with debate elements only
2. Consider adding timer/group assignment tools to weeks that don't have them
3. Review for consistency in terminology across all weeks
