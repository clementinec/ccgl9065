This guide explains the structure of weekly in-class activities. The semester uses a **leveling system** — you start with a teaser, build skills in small groups, and unlock cross-room debates when the class is ready.

---

## Semester Structure

| Level | When | Format | Goal |
|-------|------|--------|------|
| **Level 0** | Week 1 only | Two-side teaser debate | Get a taste of cross-room confrontation |
| **Level 1** | Week 2+ (default) | Vocational groups, individual presentations | Build persona, practice spectacles |
| **Level 2** | Unlocked by class | Cross-room Assembly Debates | Hardcore argumentation and cross-fire |

---

## How Level 2 Gets Unlocked

We don't rush into Assembly Debates — the class earns it.

1. **Slack tracker**: A pinned post in the Slack workspace tracks interest in "Level 2"
2. **Like to vote**: React to the post if you want to try Level 2
3. **Threshold reached**: When enough likes accumulate, we kick off Level 2 the following week
4. **After the experiment**: Class votes in person — continue Level 2, or fall back to Level 1 if it's too much

This keeps the energy student-driven without putting anyone on the spot.

# Level 0: Week 1 Teaser

*One session only — a taste of what's to come*

In Week 1, we skip straight to a simplified two-side debate:

- **Left side of room**: PRO-AI (Pro-Development)
- **Right side of room**: PRO-US (Pro-Climate)

*Note: From Week 2 onwards, we drop the AI framing and use **Pro-Dev** vs **Pro-CC** — same idea, broader scope.*

This is a teaser — chaotic, unpolished, but energizing. It shows you what Assembly Debates feel like before you've built the skills. Counts toward your attendance participation.

After Week 1, we step back and build properly.

# Level 1: Vocational Groups

*Week 2 onwards — the default mode*

## How It Works

Students are organized into **vocational (occupation-based) groups**:

| Group | Perspective |
|-------|-------------|
| **Logistics/Transportation** | Supply chains, shipping, mobility |
| **Farming/Food Procurement** | Agriculture, food systems, land use |
| **Energy and Industry** | Power generation, manufacturing |
| **Policy-Makers** | Governance, regulation, international agreements |
| **Technology and Innovation** | Tech solutions, R&D, digital tools |
| **Service/Urban Workers** | Cities, daily life, consumer perspective |

### Choosing Your Group

- **Week 2**: You'll be assigned a starting group based on seating
- **Any week after**: You can **stay** with your group or **switch** to a different one
- Switching is fine — maybe you want to explore a new perspective, or a topic fits another vocation better
- Staying is also fine — depth in one persona can be just as valuable as breadth

Just move to the new group's seating area at the start of the activity. No permission needed.

### Within Each Group

Students choose their stance based on their collected research profile:

- **Pro-Climate (Pro-CC)**: Prioritize environmental protection, sustainability
- **Pro-Development (Pro-Dev)**: Prioritize economic growth, pragmatic progress

## Weekly Activity Flow (50 min)

| Phase | Time | What Happens |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **Settle into Groups** | 2 min | Find your vocational group by seating |
| **Position Declaration** | 3 min | Declare Pro-CC or Pro-Dev based on your research |
| **Persona Creation** | 5 min | Who are you? What's your story? What do you fear losing? |
| **Research Sharing** | 10 min | Share findings within your group |
| **Individual Prep** | 10 min | Each person prepares their 5-min presentation |
| **Presentations** | 15 min | 2-3 speakers present (5 min each) |
| **Group Discussion** | 5 min | React, question, build on each other's points |

---

## The 5-Minute Presentation

Each speaker gets 5 minutes to present their argument.

| Segment | Time | Content |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Hook** | 30 sec | Open with your most powerful story or image |
| **Argument 1** | 90 sec | Your strongest point as a spectacle |
| **Argument 2** | 90 sec | Your second-strongest point |
| **Argument 3** | 60 sec | Third point or preemptive defense |
| **Close** | 30 sec | Call to action or memorable line |

### Presenter Tips

- **Don't read** — know your points, speak naturally
- **Make eye contact** — with the audience, not your notes
- **Use pauses** — let your big moments land
- **End strong** — last line should be memorable

---

## Persona Creation

This is your warmup for role-playing. Your **vocational group** is the foundation of your persona — use it as a label that grounds your arguments.

Answer these questions:

1. **Who are you?** (Name, job within your vocational group, location)
2. **What's your daily reality?** (How does climate/development affect your work?)
3. **What do you fear losing?** (Job? Community? Future?)
4. **What do you hope for?** (What's your vision of success?)

Think of your vocational label as your argumentative superpower: *"As a logistics worker..."* or *"Speaking from the farming sector..."* gives your points immediate credibility and specificity.

### Example Personas

**Pro-CC Farmer:**
> "I'm Maria, a rice farmer in the Mekong Delta. Every year the floods get worse. Last year I lost 40% of my harvest. My children want to move to the city. I fear my family's land — farmed for three generations — will be underwater by 2050."

**Pro-Dev Energy Worker:**
> "I'm James, a power plant technician in Guangdong. My plant employs 200 families from my village. When people talk about shutting down coal, they're talking about my neighbors losing their homes. I want clean energy too — but not if it means my community starves first."

---

## Participation Tracking

To earn the full **10% in-class participation**:

- Present **3 times** throughout the semester
- Can be individual presentations or representing your group
- Quality matters less than showing up and contributing

### What Counts as a Presentation

| Week | Opportunity |
|------|-------------|
| **Week 1** | Level 0 teaser debate — counts if you speak |
| **Weeks 2–11** | Level 1 or Level 2 presentations |
| **Week 12** | Portfolio presentation — counts for everyone |

So realistically: present in **Week 1 + Week 12 + one other week** and you're done.

---

# Level 2: Assembly Debates

*Unlocked when the class is ready*

## The Shift

After weeks of building comfort with personas and individual presentations, the final sessions bring the class together for **cross-room debates**.

| What Changes | Level 1 | Level 2 |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Room Layout** | Groups by occupation | Two sides: PRO-CC vs PRO-DEV |
| **Format** | Individual presentations | Cross-fire debates across the room |
| **Intensity** | Warmup, exploration | High-stakes argumentation |
| **Goal** | Build skills | Deploy skills |

### Vocational Groups Still Matter

You keep your vocational identity in Level 2 — it becomes part of your persona:

- *"As someone in Energy and Industry, I see this differently..."*
- *"From a Policy-Maker's perspective, the real issue is..."*
- *"Speaking as a farmer, let me tell you what this means on the ground..."*

Your vocational lens makes your arguments more grounded and specific.

## Assembly Debate Flow (50 min)

| Phase | Time | What Happens |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **Form Sides** | 2 min | Move to your side of the room (PRO-CC left, PRO-DEV right) |
| **Vocational Check-in** | 3 min | Within your side, note which vocational groups are represented |
| **Strategy Session** | 10 min | Pool best arguments, leverage vocational perspectives |
| **Presentation Prep** | 10 min | Craft your side's case |
| **Team Presentations** | 10 min | Each side presents (5 min each) |
| **Cross-Fire** | 12 min | Debate across the room — rebuttals, questions, challenges |
| **Debrief** | 3 min | What worked? What surprised you? |

---

## Team Roles (Level 2)

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Facilitator** | Keeps time, ensures everyone contributes |
| **Researcher** | Pulls key facts, checks sources |
| **Storyteller** | Turns facts into narratives using the Spectacle Formula |
| **Devil's Advocate** | Stress-tests arguments: "But what about...?" |
| **Presenter** | Delivers the team's case |

---

## Open Debate Rules

### Rules of Engagement

1. **Address the argument, not the person**
2. **Ask questions, don't just attack**
3. **Concede good points** — "That's fair, but..."
4. **Redirect, don't deny** — "Even if that's true, it doesn't address..."

### Useful Phrases

| To Do | Say |
|-------|-----|
| Challenge a claim | "Where's the source for that?" |
| Reframe | "You're focusing on X, but the real issue is Y" |
| Concede and counter | "That's a valid concern, but consider..." |
| Call out exaggeration | "That's one case. Is it representative?" |
| Redirect | "Even if true, does that justify...?" |

---

# Core Skills (All Levels)

## The Spectacle Formula

This is how you turn facts into arguments that land.

$$\text{Fact} + \text{Human Story} + \text{Stakes} = \text{Spectacle}$$

### Levels of Argument

| Level | Example | Impact |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Weak** | "AI uses energy" | Forgettable |
| **Better** | "AI uses more electricity than Pakistan" | Surprising |
| **Spectacle** | "Your ChatGPT query costs a town its drinking water" | Unforgettable |

### How to Build a Spectacle

1. **Start with a fact** — verified, sourced, real
2. **Find the human** — who is affected? Name them if possible
3. **Raise the stakes** — what's at risk? What's lost?
4. **Make it personal** — connect to your audience's life

---

## The Line: Persuasion vs. Propaganda

| Persuasion (OK) | Propaganda (NOT OK) |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Selecting real facts | Inventing facts |
| Framing verified stories | Fabricating stories |
| Making real data vivid | Exaggerating beyond evidence |
| Sourced statistics | Made-up numbers |

**Before you use any story, ask:**

1. Can I cite a source?
2. Could someone fact-check this and find it's true?
3. Am I framing reality or inventing it?

If you can't answer YES to all three — don't use it.

## Weekly Documentation

### What to Track in Your Notion Portfolio

Each week, add:

```
WEEK [#]: [Topic]

MY POSITION THIS WEEK: [PRO-CC / PRO-DEV]

MY VOCATIONAL GROUP: [e.g., Energy and Industry]

BEST FACT I FOUND:
- Source:
- Why it matters:

BEST STORY I HEARD (from either side):
- What it was:
- Why it worked:

MY ARGUMENT (the one I delivered or helped build):
- Fact:
- Human story:
- Stakes:

WHAT I LEARNED:
- About the topic:
- About argumentation:
```

## The Goal

You're not here to "win" debates. You're here to:

1. **Build comfort** — with role-play, public speaking, argumentation
2. **Understand all sides** — argue PRO-CC one week, PRO-DEV the next
3. **Develop narrative skills** — turn data into stories people feel
4. **Recognize persuasion** — know it when you see it, know how to do it
5. **Stay honest** — powerful arguments that are also true

**Facts don't change minds. Stories do. Your job: Tell true stories that move people.**
