This guide explains the structure of weekly in-class activities. Keep this handy throughout the semester.

---

## The Weekly Rhythm

Every week follows the same pattern:

| Phase | Time | What Happens |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **Lecture** | 50 min | Facts, stakes, ammunition for both sides |
| **Activity** | 50 min | Groups form, synthesize, present, debate |

---

## Activity Flow (50 min)

### The Standard Structure

| Phase | Time | What to Do |
|-------|------|------------|
| **Form Groups** | 2 min | Split into PRO and CON sides |
| **Assign Roles** | 3 min | Each person takes a role |
| **Persona Creation** | 5 min | Who are you? What's your story? |
| **Research Synthesis** | 10 min | Pool your homework, build arguments |
| **Presentation Prep** | 10 min | Craft your 3 key points as stories |
| **Presentations** | 10 min | Each side presents (5 min each) |
| **Open Debate** | 8 min | Cross-fire, rebuttals, questions |
| **Debrief** | 2 min | Key takeaways, what worked |

---

## Group Roles

Assign these at the start of each activity. Rotate weekly so everyone tries different roles.

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Facilitator** | Keeps time, moves discussion forward, ensures everyone contributes |
| **Researcher** | Pulls key facts from everyone's homework, checks sources |
| **Storyteller** | Turns facts into narratives using the Spectacle Formula |
| **Devil's Advocate** | Stress-tests arguments: "But what about...?" |
| **Presenter** | Delivers the group's case to the class |

### Why Roles Matter

Without roles, groups default to:
- One person doing all the work
- Circular discussions that go nowhere
- Arguments that stay at the "fact" level

With roles:
- Everyone has a job
- Discussion has direction
- Arguments become stories

---

## The Spectacle Formula

This is how you turn facts into arguments that land.

$$\text{Fact} + \text{Human Story} + \text{Stakes} = \text{Spectacle}$$

### Levels of Argument

| Level | Example | Impact |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Weak** | "AI uses energy" | Forgettable |
| **Better** | "AI uses more electricity than Pakistan" | Surprising |
| **Spectacle** | "Your ChatGPT query costs a town its drinking water" | Unforgettable |

### How to Build a Spectacle

1. **Start with a fact** — verified, sourced, real
2. **Find the human** — who is affected? Name them if possible
3. **Raise the stakes** — what's at risk? What's lost?
4. **Make it personal** — connect to your audience's life

### The Line: Persuasion vs. Propaganda

| Persuasion (OK) | Propaganda (NOT OK) |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Selecting real facts | Inventing facts |
| Framing verified stories | Fabricating stories |
| Making real data vivid | Exaggerating beyond evidence |
| Sourced statistics | Made-up numbers |

**Before you use any story, ask:**

1. Can I cite a source?
2. Could someone fact-check this and find it's true?
3. Am I framing reality or inventing it?

If you can't answer YES to all three — don't use it.

---

## Research Synthesis (10 min)

This is where your pre-class homework becomes group ammunition.

### The Flow

| Step | Time | What to Do |
|------|------|------------|
| **Share** | 3 min | Everyone reads out their best finding from Slack/Notion |
| **Sort** | 3 min | Group findings by theme: Energy? Jobs? Equity? |
| **Select** | 2 min | Pick your 3 strongest facts |
| **Story** | 2 min | Storyteller drafts narratives for each |

### Synthesis Questions

- What's the **most surprising** fact we have?
- What's the **most human** story we can tell?
- What fact do we have that the **other side can't counter**?
- What's our **weakest point** and how do we defend it?

---

## Presentation Prep (10 min)

### Structure Your 5 Minutes

| Segment | Time | Content |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Hook** | 30 sec | Open with your most powerful story/image |
| **Argument 1** | 90 sec | Your strongest point as a spectacle |
| **Argument 2** | 90 sec | Your second-strongest point |
| **Argument 3** | 60 sec | Third point or preemptive defense |
| **Close** | 30 sec | Call to action or memorable line |

### Presenter Tips

- **Don't read** — know your points, speak naturally
- **Make eye contact** — with the other side, not just your team
- **Use pauses** — let your big moments land
- **End strong** — last line should be memorable

---

## Open Debate (8 min)

### Rules of Engagement

1. **Address the argument, not the person**
2. **Ask questions, don't just attack**
3. **Concede good points** — "That's fair, but..."
4. **Redirect, don't deny** — "Even if that's true, it doesn't address..."

### Useful Phrases

| To Do | Say |
|-------|-----|
| Challenge a claim | "Where's the source for that?" |
| Reframe | "You're focusing on X, but the real issue is Y" |
| Concede and counter | "That's a valid concern, but consider..." |
| Call out exaggeration | "That's one case. Is it representative?" |
| Redirect | "Even if true, does that justify...?" |

---

## Debrief (2 min)

Quick reflection at the end:

- What argument from the **other side** actually worked on you?
- What was your side's **weakest moment**?
- What would you do **differently** next time?

---

## Weekly Documentation

### What to Track in Your Notion Portfolio

Each week, add:

```
WEEK [#]: [Topic]

MY POSITION THIS WEEK: [PRO-X / PRO-Y]

BEST FACT I FOUND:
- Source:
- Why it matters:

BEST STORY I HEARD (from either side):
- What it was:
- Why it worked:

MY ARGUMENT (the one I delivered or helped build):
- Fact:
- Human story:
- Stakes:

WHAT I LEARNED:
- About the topic:
- About argumentation:
```

### Why Document?

1. Your portfolio grows all semester
2. Final project draws from your weekly work
3. Patterns emerge — you'll see what kinds of arguments you're good at
4. You own your intellectual development

## The Goal

You're not here to "win" debates. You're here to:

1. **Understand all sides** — argue PRO one week, CON the next
2. **Build narrative skills** — turn data into stories people feel
3. **Recognize persuasion** — know it when you see it, know how to do it
4. **Stay honest** — powerful arguments that are also true

**Facts don't change minds. Stories do. Your job: Tell true stories that move people.**
