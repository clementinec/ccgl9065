## Semester Structure

| Level | When | Format | Goal |
|-------|------|--------|------|
| **Level 0** | Week 1 only | Two-side teaser debate | Get a taste of cross-room confrontation |
| **Level 1** | Week 2+ (default) | Vocational groups, individual presentations | Build persona, practice spectacles |
| **Level 2** | Unlocked by class | Cross-room Assembly Debates | Hardcore argumentation and cross-fire |

---

## How Level 2 Gets Unlocked

We don't rush into Assembly Debates — the class earns it.

1. **Slack tracker**: A pinned post in the Slack workspace tracks interest in "Level 2"
2. **Like to vote**: React to the post if you want to try Level 2
3. **Threshold reached**: When enough likes accumulate, we kick off Level 2 the following week
4. **After the experiment**: Class votes in person — continue Level 2, or fall back to Level 1 if it's too much

# Level 0: Week 1 Teaser

::: {.callout-warning}
## Level 0 at a Glance
**When**: Week 1 only | **Format**: Full class, two sides | **Vibe**: Chaotic but energizing
:::

In Week 1, we skip straight to a simplified two-side debate:

- **Left side of room**: PRO-AI (Pro-Development)
- **Right side of room**: PRO-US (Pro-Climate)

*Note: From Week 2 onwards, we drop the AI framing and use **Pro-Dev** vs **Pro-CC** — same idea, broader scope.*

This is a teaser — chaotic, unpolished, but energizing. It shows you what Assembly Debates feel like before you've built the skills. Counts toward your participation if you speak.

After Week 1, we step back and build properly.

# Level 1: Vocational Groups

::: {.callout-tip}
## Level 1 at a Glance
**When**: Week 2 onwards (default) | **Format**: Small groups by occupation | **Vibe**: Skill-building, low pressure
:::

## How It Works

Students are organized into **vocational (occupation-based) groups**:

| Group | Perspective |
|-------|-------------|
| **Logistics/Transportation** | Supply chains, shipping, mobility |
| **Farming/Food Procurement** | Agriculture, food systems, land use |
| **Energy and Industry** | Power generation, manufacturing |
| **Policy-Makers** | Governance, regulation, international agreements |
| **Technology and Innovation** | Tech solutions, R&D, digital tools |
| **Service/Urban Workers** | Cities, daily life, consumer perspective |

### Choosing Your Group

- **Week 2**: You'll be assigned a starting group based on seating
- **Any week after**: You can **stay** with your group or **switch** to a different one
- Switching is fine — maybe you want to explore a new perspective, or a topic fits another vocation better
- Staying is also fine — depth in one persona can be just as valuable as breadth

Just move to the new group's seating area at the start of the activity. No permission needed.

### Within Each Group

Students choose their stance based on their collected research profile:

- **Pro-Climate (Pro-CC)**: Prioritize environmental protection, sustainability
- **Pro-Development (Pro-Dev)**: Prioritize economic growth, pragmatic progress

## Weekly Activity Flow (50 min)

| Phase | Time | What Happens |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **Settle into Groups** | 2 min | Find your vocational group by seating |
| **Position Exchange** | 3 min | Quick round: declare Pro-CC or Pro-Dev, share one-line take |
| **Group Presentations** | 35 min | Each group presents (~5 min max per group) |
| **Wrap-Up** | 5 min | Reactions, standout moments, preview next week |
| *Buffer* | 5 min | Overflow / transition time |

::: {.callout-tip}
## On Presentation Length
5 minutes is the **maximum**, not a target. Brevity is memorable — if you can land your point in 2 minutes, do it. Each of the 6 vocational groups should get a chance to present each week.
:::

## The 5-Minute Presentation

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Presentation Structure (click to expand)

| Segment | Time | Content |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Hook** | 30 sec | Open with your most powerful story or image |
| **Argument 1** | 90 sec | Your strongest point as a spectacle |
| **Argument 2** | 90 sec | Your second-strongest point |
| **Argument 3** | 60 sec | Third point or preemptive defense |
| **Close** | 30 sec | Call to action or memorable line |

**Presenter Tips:**

- **Don't read** — know your points, speak naturally
- **Make eye contact** — with the audience, not your notes
- **Use pauses** — let your big moments land
- **End strong** — last line should be memorable
:::

---

## Persona Creation

Your **vocational group** is the foundation of your persona — use it as a label that grounds your arguments.

Answer these questions:

1. **Who are you?** (Name, job within your vocational group, location)
2. **What's your daily reality?** (How does climate/development affect your work?)
3. **What do you fear losing?** (Job? Community? Future?)
4. **What do you hope for?** (What's your vision of success?)

Think of your vocational label as your argumentative superpower: *"As a logistics worker..."* or *"Speaking from the farming sector..."* gives your points immediate credibility and specificity.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Example Personas (click to expand)

**Pro-CC Farmer:**
> "I'm Maria, a rice farmer in the Mekong Delta. Every year the floods get worse. Last year I lost 40% of my harvest. My children want to move to the city. I fear my family's land — farmed for three generations — will be underwater by 2050."

**Pro-Dev Energy Worker:**
> "I'm James, a power plant technician in Guangdong. My plant employs 200 families from my village. When people talk about shutting down coal, they're talking about my neighbors losing their homes. I want clean energy too — but not if it means my community starves first."

## Participation Tracking

::: {.callout-important}
## How to Get Full Marks (10%)

Present **3 times** throughout the semester. That's it.

| Week | Opportunity |
|------|-------------|
| **Week 1** | Level 0 teaser debate — counts if you speak |
| **Weeks 2–11** | Level 1 or Level 2 presentations |
| **Week 12** | Portfolio presentation — counts for everyone |

**Realistically**: Week 1 + Week 12 + one other week = done.
:::

# Level 2: Assembly Debates

::: {.callout-important}
## Level 2 at a Glance
**When**: Unlocked by class vote | **Format**: Full class, cross-room | **Vibe**: High-stakes, deploy your skills
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## The Real Goal of Level 2
Level 2 isn't just about being persuasive — it's about **winning personas**. Can you craft an argument that makes the farmer on the other side think twice? Can you speak in a way that a policy-maker *hears*? The goal is to understand how different personas experience the debate — and reach them where they are.
:::

## The Shift

After weeks of building comfort with personas and individual presentations, the final sessions bring the class together for **cross-room debates**.

| What Changes | Level 1 | Level 2 |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| **Room Layout** | Groups by occupation | Two sides: PRO-CC vs PRO-DEV |
| **Format** | Individual presentations | Cross-fire debates across the room |
| **Intensity** | Warmup, exploration | High-stakes argumentation |
| **Goal** | Build skills | Deploy skills |

### Vocational Groups Still Matter

You keep your vocational identity in Level 2 — it becomes part of your persona:

- *"As someone in Energy and Industry, I see this differently..."*
- *"From a Policy-Maker's perspective, the real issue is..."*
- *"Speaking as a farmer, let me tell you what this means on the ground..."*

Your vocational lens makes your arguments more grounded and specific.

## Vocational Prep is Optional
During Level 2 strategy sessions, groups with members from the same vocation **may choose to huddle together** first — your shared perspective can help you prep faster. Then rejoin your PRO-CC or PRO-DEV side.
:::

---

## Assembly Debate Flow (50 min)

| Phase | Time | What Happens |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **Form Sides** | 2 min | Move to your side of the room (PRO-CC left, PRO-DEV right) |
| **Vocational Check-in** | 3 min | Within your side, note which vocational groups are represented |
| **Strategy Session** | 10 min | Pool best arguments, leverage vocational perspectives |
| **Presentation Prep** | 10 min | Craft your side's case |
| **Team Presentations** | 10 min | Each side presents (5 min each) |
| **Cross-Fire** | 12 min | Debate across the room — rebuttals, questions, challenges |
| **Debrief** | 3 min | What worked? What surprised you? |

---

## Team Roles (Level 2)

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Facilitator** | Keeps time, ensures everyone contributes |
| **Researcher** | Pulls key facts, checks sources |
| **Storyteller** | Turns facts into narratives using the Spectacle Formula |
| **Devil's Advocate** | Stress-tests arguments: "But what about...?" |
| **Presenter** | Delivers the team's case |

---

## Open Debate Rules

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Rules & Useful Phrases (click to expand)

### Rules of Engagement

1. **Address the argument, not the person**
2. **Ask questions, don't just attack**
3. **Concede good points** — "That's fair, but..."
4. **Redirect, don't deny** — "Even if that's true, it doesn't address..."

### Useful Phrases

| To Do | Say |
|-------|-----|
| Challenge a claim | "Where's the source for that?" |
| Reframe | "You're focusing on X, but the real issue is Y" |
| Concede and counter | "That's a valid concern, but consider..." |
| Call out exaggeration | "That's one case. Is it representative?" |
| Redirect | "Even if true, does that justify...?" |

# Core Skills (All Levels)

## The Spectacle Formula

::: {.callout-note}
## The Formula
$$\text{Fact} + \text{Human Story} + \text{Stakes} = \text{Spectacle}$$
:::

### Levels of Argument

| Level | Example | Impact |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Weak** | "AI uses energy" | Forgettable |
| **Better** | "AI uses more electricity than Pakistan" | Surprising |
| **Spectacle** | "Your ChatGPT query costs a town its drinking water" | Unforgettable |

### How to Build a Spectacle

1. **Start with a fact** — verified, sourced, real
2. **Find the human** — who is affected? Name them if possible
3. **Raise the stakes** — what's at risk? What's lost?
4. **Make it personal** — connect to your audience's life

---

## The Line: Persuasion vs. Propaganda

::: {.callout-warning}
## Know the Difference

| Persuasion (OK) | Propaganda (NOT OK) |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Selecting real facts | Inventing facts |
| Framing verified stories | Fabricating stories |
| Making real data vivid | Exaggerating beyond evidence |
| Sourced statistics | Made-up numbers |

**Before you use any story, ask:**

1. Can I cite a source?
2. Could someone fact-check this and find it's true?
3. Am I framing reality or inventing it?

If you can't answer YES to all three — don't use it.

## The Goal

You're not here to "win" debates. You're here to:

1. **Build comfort** — with role-play, public speaking, argumentation
2. **Understand all sides** — argue PRO-CC one week, PRO-DEV the next
3. **Develop narrative skills** — turn data into stories people feel
4. **Recognize persuasion** — know it when you see it, know how to do it
5. **Stay honest** — powerful arguments that are also true

::: {.callout-note}
## Wear Your Persona
Throughout the semester, you're encouraged to **wear your hand-selected persona** in every class. Reflect on how "being" a farmer, a policy-maker, or an energy worker changes what you notice, what bothers you, and what arguments *land* for you.

The deeper insight: by wearing a persona, you start to **hear** other personas differently. That's the real skill — not just speaking persuasively, but understanding how others receive what you say.
:::

::: {.callout-important}
## The Bottom Line
**Facts don't change minds. Stories do. Your job: Tell true stories that move people — and learn to hear how different people hear those stories.**
