## 1: Introduction to the Modern Space Race
- Renewed interest in space:
  - New players: Private companies, billionaires
  - Goals: Mars colonization, space tourism
- Dual narrative:
  - Progress vs. escapism concerns

## Space Race

## 2: Historical Context - The Original Space Race
- US vs. USSR competition:
  - Sputnik launch (1957)
  - Moon landing (1969)
- Symbolized:
  - National pride
  - Technological superiority

## 3: Historical vs. Modern Space Race
- Then: Government-led
  - Apollo program budget: ~$25.4 billion (~$150 billion in today's dollars)
- Now: Private sector involvement
  - SpaceX valuation: Over $100 billion as of 2021
  - Competitors catching up but not fast enough

## 4: The Billionaire's Space Race
- Elon Musk's SpaceX:
  - Goal: Mars colonization
  - Anecdote: Launched a Tesla into space (2018)
- Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin:
  - Focus: Space tourism
  - Quote: "We need to move heavy industry into space."
- Now out: Virgin Galactic (Virgin Orbit)

## 5: Environmental Impact - Spacecraft Emissions
- Rocket emissions:
  - Can release 300 tons of CO2 per launch
  - Does not get publicized on how this can be reduced as space explorations goes full commercial as tourism
- Comparison:
  - A single space shuttle launch = ~23 hours of 747 air travel emissions

## 6: Costs of Space Exploration
- Financials:
  - NASAâ€™s Mars Perseverance Rover mission cost: ~$2.7 billion
- Debate:
  - Allocation towards terrestrial vs. space issues

## 6.1 Space Tourism Going Private
- **Space X**: 
  - Drastically reduced cost of space launch with Falcon rockets
  - Avg. cost per launch now around $62 million (contrast to $100 to $500 million prior to Falcon)
- Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic
  - Suborbital space tourism
  - Ticket around $250,000 per passenger

## 7: Unintended Benefits of Space Exploration
- Technological spinoffs:
  - GPS technology, initially for military/naval use
  - Memory foam, developed for aircraft cushions
- Anecdote:
  - Camera phones using tech developed for space imaging

## 8: The Debate on Extraterrestrial Life
- Search efforts:
  - Mars rovers searching for microbial life signs
- Philosophical implication:
  - "Are we alone?" A question driving human curiosity

## 9: Ethical Considerations of Space Colonization
- Terraforming Mars:
  - Ethical debate on transforming another planet
- Protecting potential life:
  - Planetary protection protocols to avoid contamination

## 10: The "Escape Plan" Mentality
- Critique:
  - Viewing space as an "escape" from Earth's issues
- Anecdote:
  - Stephen Hawking's warning about Earth's fragility and the need for an alternative
- Interesting Pop Culture/Sci-Fi Reference: The Wandering Earth

## 11: Space Exploration and Global Power Dynamics
- **New "Cold War"**:
  - Space as a geopolitical arena
    - U.S. Space Force (2019)
    - China's Chang'e Program (2020)
    - UAE's Hope Probe (2021)
  - Nations showcasing technological prowess.
- **International Competition**:
  - Moon and Mars missions by various countries.
  - Satellite launches for national security and communication.
- Limitation of existing treaty: Outer Space Treaty (1967)
- Anti-Satellite Tests: U.S. Russia, China, India

## 12: Public Perception and Oversight
- **Public Engagement**:
  - Growing interest in space tourism.
  - Debates on the ethical implications of colonization.
- **Oversight Concerns**:
  - Calls for transparent governance of space activities.
  - Concerns over weaponization and space debris management.

## 13: Sustainability in Space Exploration
- **Green Propulsion**:
  - Development of eco-friendly rocket fuels.
  - Reduction in launch emissions.
- **Space Debris Mitigation**:
  - Initiatives for debris tracking and removal.
  - International agreements on responsible space activities.

## 14: Future Visions - Where Are We Heading?
- **Mars Colonization**:
  - Plans for sustainable habitats on Mars.
  - Research on closed-loop life support systems.
- **Asteroid Mining**:
  - Potential for extracting valuable minerals.
  - Ethical and legal considerations of exploiting extraterrestrial resources.

## 15: Reflecting on Our Place in the Universe
- **Cosmic Perspective**:
  - The "Overview Effect": Astronauts' profound experience of seeing Earth from space.
  - Realizing Earth's uniqueness and vulnerability.
- **Stewardship and Exploration**:
  - Balancing the drive to explore with the responsibility to protect our home planet and its ecosystems.

## 16: The Growing Problem of Space Debris
- **Space Junk Stats**:
  - Over 500,000 pieces of debris tracked in orbit.
  - Threats to satellites and the International Space Station (ISS).
- **Collision Risks**:
  - High-speed impacts with even small debris can cause significant damage.
  - Notable incidents: Damage to space shuttles, satellite collisions.

## 17: The Challenges of Space Waste Management

  - Ensuring space exploration benefits humanity without compromising Earth's ecological balance.

## 20. Change of Plan with role-finding this week
#### Experts/KOLs on:
- Space Exploration Advocacy versus
- Vowing to pause space exploration for more important issues like climate change
#### General Public as:
1. Educators and academics from STEM
2. Policy makers and government officials
3. Business leaders and entrepreneurs in energy sector
4. Social scientists and ethicists 
5. Tech industry professionals
6. Self-defined (Pick as you wish)

## 21. Wrapping up CCGL9065
- Foster critical thinking
- We have one topic
  - From which we picked two different sides
    - From each sides there are a multitude of angles of expression
      - What left a mark on your perception?
        - <span style= "color: red">And how can you influence other people with these experience?</span>

## Practical Question: Essay-Writing Clarification
"Student will write a final reflection (up to 750 words) leveraging understanding of arguments from class to narrate a story that they think best presents the solution that will move the most people in promoting climate change understanding, awareness and provide maximum impact."

- **YOUR** response to climate change with HK 2100 in mind
- "story" not to be confused with "fiction"
  - story-telling over story-creation
- **Objective**: Write a reflective essay (750 words max) that uses a narrative to propose a realistic climate change solution.
- **Grading criteria:**
  - address the task aka provide an individual response in writing
  - show engagement with course perspectives/materials and overarching climate change theme
  - present clear, logical argument from various perspectives, including counter-evidence
  - coherent structure with clear instruction and conclusion, proper paragraphing, minimal language errors and  
- **Final Note**: The essay and visual should not only reflect academic insights but also aim to inspire broader awareness and action on climate change.
