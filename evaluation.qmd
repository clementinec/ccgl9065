## Weekly Research & Reflection

::: {.callout-tip}
## What does "Reflection" mean?
This isn't just journaling. Each week you **research** (find facts, stories, sources) AND **reflect** (what does this mean for you? how does it change your thinking? what surprised you?). Your Notion portfolio should show both: the evidence you gathered AND your thinking about it.
:::

Your weekly contributions are graded on **three equally important criteria**:

## Pillar 1: Verifiability (Can It Be Fact-Checked?)

**This is non-negotiable.** Every fact, statistic, and story must have a source.

| Grade | What It Looks Like |
|-------|-------------------|
| **A** | Every claim has a credible source (academic papers, major news outlets, official reports). Sources are recent and relevant. You could defend this in a court of fact-checkers. |
| **B** | Most claims sourced, sources are credible. One or two minor claims might lack citation but are easily verifiable. |
| **C** | Some sources provided, but quality is inconsistent. Some claims come from questionable sources (random blogs, old data, biased outlets). |
| **D** | Few or no sources. Claims are vague ("studies show...") without specifics. Would fail a basic fact-check. |
| **F** | Invented facts, fabricated statistics, or made-up stories. **This is academic dishonesty.** |

### Acceptable Sources

- Academic journals, peer-reviewed papers
- Major news outlets (Reuters, AP, BBC, NYT, SCMP, etc.)
- Government reports, UN/IPCC data
- Official company reports, press releases
- Reputable NGOs (WHO, Greenpeace, WWF, etc.)

### Unacceptable Sources

- Random blogs, personal websites
- Social media posts (unless citing the original source)
- Wikipedia (use it to *find* sources, not *as* a source)
- "I heard that..." or "Everyone knows..."
- AI-generated "facts" (ChatGPT can hallucinate)

---

## Pillar 2: Creativity (Is Your Spectacle Compelling?)

You're not just reporting facts — you're **crafting narratives that move people**.

| Grade | What It Looks Like |
|-------|-------------------|
| **A** | Your spectacle makes people *feel* something. Original framing that connects facts to human stakes. Memorable, quotable, emotionally resonant. Would work in a real campaign. |
| **B** | Good attempt at emotional framing. The connection between fact and feeling is clear. Competent but not striking. |
| **C** | Basic restatement of facts with some emotional language added. Feels formulaic. "AI is bad because it uses energy." |
| **D** | Just listing facts with no narrative craft. No attempt to make it memorable or emotional. Reads like a Wikipedia summary. |
| **F** | No original thought. Copy-pasted from sources. Or: fabricated emotional stories (see Verifiability). |

### The Transformation Test

**Weak (D):** "AI data centers consume 415 TWh of electricity annually."

**Better (C):** "AI data centers use a huge amount of electricity — more than many countries."

**Good (B):** "AI data centers consume more electricity than Pakistan, a country of 240 million people." *(Source: IEA 2024)*

**Excellent (A):** "Training one large AI model emits as much carbon as five cars over their entire lifetimes. And we're building thousands of them — while telling kids to recycle." *(Source: Strubell et al. 2019)*

::: {.callout-note}
## Real example of fact-checking failure
An earlier draft of this page claimed "one ChatGPT query powers a Pakistani home for a week." That sounded dramatic — but the math doesn't check out (a query uses ~0.01 kWh; a home uses ~50+ kWh/week). **We caught it because we applied the same test we're teaching you.** Always verify before you amplify.

## Pillar 3: Conciseness (Did You Say It Efficiently?)

**Longer is not better.** Verbose writing signals unclear thinking.

| Grade | What It Looks Like |
|-------|-------------------|
| **A** | Every word earns its place. Dense with insight, zero filler. Clear, punchy, memorable. |
| **B** | Mostly efficient. Some sentences could be tightened but overall well-edited. |
| **C** | Noticeable padding. Repetitive points. Could cut 30% without losing meaning. |
| **D** | Rambling, unfocused. Buries good points in walls of text. Reader loses interest. |
| **F** | Incoherent or clearly padded to meet a word count that doesn't exist. |

### Word Count Guidelines

| Component | Target | Maximum |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Weekly Notion entry** | 300-500 words | 750 words |
| **Slack post** | 100-150 words | 200 words |
| **Spectacle draft** | 1-2 sentences | 3 sentences |
| **Final essay** | 600-750 words | 750 words (hard cap) |

**Penalty for excessive length:** If you exceed the maximum by more than 20%, you lose one grade step (e.g., A → A-, B+ → B).

## Weekly Contribution Examples

### Example A: Excellent

```markdown
**[PRO CLIMATE]**

📊 **My Fact:**
Training GPT-4 emitted an estimated 552 tons of CO₂ — equivalent to
driving a car around Earth 22 times.
Source: Strubell et al., 2019 (updated estimates via MIT Tech Review 2023)

📖 **My Story:**
In 2024, a Rice University engineering student took their own life.
Friends reported overwhelming pressure from AI replacing entry-level jobs
— the very jobs students train years to get.
Source: Houston Chronicle, March 2024

💥 **My Spectacle:**
"You're training for jobs that won't exist by graduation. And every time
you cheer for AI progress, you're cheering for your own obsolescence —
powered by coal plants that give kids asthma."

🔗 Full research: [Notion link]
```

**Why this is an A:**
- Facts are specific, sourced, verifiable
- Story is real, documented, emotionally resonant
- Spectacle connects personal stakes (your job) to systemic harm (coal plants)
- Concise — says a lot in few words

---

### Example B: Good

```markdown
**[PRO CLIMATE]**

📊 **My Fact:**
AI data centers are projected to use 945 TWh by 2030, more than
doubling from 2024 levels.
Source: IEA Energy and AI Report 2024

📖 **My Story:**
Microsoft pledged to be carbon negative by 2030, but their emissions
increased 29% in 2023, largely due to AI infrastructure expansion.
Source: Microsoft Sustainability Report 2024

💥 **My Spectacle:**
"Tech companies promise green AI while their emissions skyrocket.
The pledge is marketing; the coal plant is real."

🔗 Full research: [Notion link]
```

**Why this is a B:**
- Well-sourced, verifiable facts
- Story is corporate-level (less personal resonance)
- Spectacle is clear but less emotionally punchy than an A

---

### Example C: Adequate

```markdown
**[PRO CLIMATE]**

📊 **My Fact:**
AI uses a lot of energy and this is growing fast.
Source: Various news articles

📖 **My Story:**
Many tech workers are worried about AI taking their jobs and
causing environmental problems.

💥 **My Spectacle:**
"AI is bad for the environment and we should be concerned about it."

🔗 Full research: [Notion link]
```

**Why this is a C:**
- Fact is vague, source is "various"
- Story is generic, no specific case
- Spectacle is a bland statement, not emotionally compelling
- Would pass a fact-check but doesn't demonstrate mastery

---

### Example D: Poor

```markdown
**[PRO CLIMATE]**

📊 **My Fact:**
Studies show AI is destroying the planet.

📖 **My Story:**
I heard that lots of people are dying because of AI pollution.

💥 **My Spectacle:**
AI is killing us all and nobody cares.

🔗 Full research: None
```

**Why this is a D:**
- No sources
- "Studies show" and "I heard" are red flags
- Story is unverifiable
- Spectacle is hyperbolic without factual backing
- Would fail a fact-check

---

### Example F: Failing

```markdown
**[PRO CLIMATE]**

📊 **My Fact:**
AI has already killed 50,000 people from pollution-related deaths
in the US alone.

📖 **My Story:**
There was a village in China where everyone died because a data
center poisoned their water supply.

💥 **My Spectacle:**
"Big Tech is literally committing genocide and the government is
covering it up."

🔗 Full research: None needed, it's obvious
```

**Why this is an F:**
- Fabricated statistics
- Invented story
- Inflammatory claims without evidence
- This is misinformation, not persuasion
- **Academic integrity violation**

## Video Essay (20%)

A **1-minute video** using your own voice, images, and text on how climate change affects you personally.

| Criterion | What We're Looking For |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Personal Connection** | It's about *you* — your life, your community, your future. Not abstract facts. |
| **Narrative Arc** | Has a beginning, middle, end. Takes the viewer somewhere. |
| **Production Quality** | Clear audio, readable text, intentional visuals. Doesn't need to be fancy — needs to be watchable. |
| **Fact-Grounded** | Any claims you make should be verifiable (same rules as weekly work). |

---

## Final Reflective Essay (20%)

A **750-word narrative** that synthesizes what you've learned and advocates for a climate solution that could move people to action.

| Criterion | What We're Looking For |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Synthesis** | Draws on arguments and evidence from across the semester — not just one week. |
| **Persuasive Narrative** | Tells a story, not a report. Makes the reader *feel* something. |
| **Actionable** | Points toward something people can actually do. Not despair — direction. |
| **Polished Writing** | Clear, concise, well-structured. Every sentence earns its place. |

---

## Visual Creation (20%)

A **collage or visual piece** that communicates your climate solution alongside your final essay.

| Criterion | What We're Looking For |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Coherence with Essay** | The visual and written work tell the same story in different languages. |
| **Visual Impact** | Grabs attention. Would work on a gallery wall or protest sign. |
| **Intentional Choices** | Colors, composition, imagery — all deliberate, all meaningful. |
| **Craft** | Shows effort and care. Medium doesn't matter (digital, collage, illustration) — execution does. |

---

## The Golden Rule

```{=html}
<div style="background: #1a1a2e; padding: 40px; border-radius: 12px; text-align: center; margin: 30px 0; border: 2px solid #f39c12;">
  <h2 style="margin: 0; color: #f39c12; font-size: 1.8em;">Everything must be fact-checkable.</h2>
  <p style="margin: 20px 0 0 0; font-size: 1.25em; color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.6;">
    You're learning to persuade with <strong style="color: #4ade80;">real stories</strong>, not to deceive with fake ones.<br>
    The power of a spectacle comes from its <strong style="color: #4ade80;">truth</strong> — not from invention.
  </p>
</div>
```

## Quick Self-Check Before Submitting

Ask yourself:

1. ✅ Can someone Google my facts and find them true?
2. ✅ Did I cite specific, credible sources?
3. ✅ Is my story about real people/events, not hypotheticals?
4. ✅ Does my spectacle make people *feel* something?
5. ✅ Could I cut 20% without losing meaning?
6. ✅ Would I be comfortable defending this in a debate?

If you answered "no" to any of these, revise before submitting.

## Questions?

Unclear about whether something counts as a credible source? Ask in `#general` on Slack or come to office hours. Better to check than to lose marks.
