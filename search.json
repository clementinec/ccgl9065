    "text": "What’s the Difference between Climate and Weather?\nHeading out for a walk on a chilly spring morning, you notice misty clouds on the hills in the distance. You’re feeling eager for summer to arrive, but the hillsides are just beginning to green up after the end of winter. You wonder, “Is it cooler than usual this spring? I think I’m usually wearing shorts by this time of year.” Thinking about the weather, you recognize what you’re really concerned about is if it will rain on your barbecue this weekend…\nThese are some of the everyday thoughts people have about weather and climate. Though climate and weather are closely related, they aren’t the same thing.\n\nWhether there is mist on the mountains on a given morning is a weather question. Whether such misty mornings are common or unusual is a climate question. Photo by Betsy Youngman."

People describe weather in terms of temperature, precipitation, humidity, cloudiness, wind, and other variables. Weather can vary from minute to minute and location to location. For instance, it’s not unusual for a place to have a cloudy, wet morning that gives way to a sunny afternoon, or for rain to fall on one side of a town, but not the other. In order to make sense, descriptions of weather always include both time and location.\n\nExample of weather"

In the United States, daily observations at stations that meet specified criteria, methodically collected by volunteer observers and automated weather stations, are used to document our weather and climate. One volunteer weather observer program in the United States is the Cooperative Observer Program (COOP).\nThis program, which includes more than 11,000 stations, is key to obtaining accurate observations across the country. Started in 1890, the COOP network now spans all corners of our nation: from mountaintops to meadows, urban to rural regions, and from seashores to suburbs.\nInternationally this program also covers a great number of weather stations that are collectively recorded on NOAA.gov from the United States."
