## Recapping on Literature Review
- Grades & Comments published on Moodle
- Major reasons that the grades may not apear to be satisfying:
  - formatting is off
  - recouting, synthesis are in, but critical lens are missing
    - question literature if you could
  - if you need any clarifications feel free to reach out to me for time to catch up next week on this during office hour
    - we may arrange in-class seminar session if demands are high enough

## Group Project Example
  - Already posted on Moodle
  - Quick walk-through lookouts:
    - framework
    - contents that are expected
    - just an example so not the final 'solution manual' that you will need to follow
    - typical length that is expected, so nothing major
    - demonstrates how you have leveraged techniques learnt in this class to investigate problems at hand
  - Let's take a quick look

# Research

## Why there's a Group/Individual (interview-based) Project
  - Practicing **Research** in non-academic setting
  - Reaching out to people with some predetermined agenda
  - Attempt on additional insight by taking in first-hand primary data through interviews
  - Something that wasn't possible with existing framework on your more 'academic' research
  - Opportunity to collect data and synthesize insights
  - Recognize and celebrate the <span style='color: orange'>inherent bias</span> that you bring in

## Pros and Cons: Working as a Group vs. Individual
  - Working as a group, you will:
    - Get a chance to reach more people thus expanding your professional network
    - Write a smaller portion of the overall report on findings, however in the meantime
    - _losing control over showflow and_
    - _unable to push the conversation in desired directions, potentially leaving questions unanswered._
  - Working as an individual, you will:
    - Reach more people (unlike previously which was per-person level) and expand professional network further
    - have more control over how the conversation goes and ask questions that resonates more with you,
    - free to manipulate the formation of your final group report to be more consistent with your vision yet
    - _less likely to get more positive answer to do a sit-down interview, even a zoom-based one and_
    - _write the full report on one's own and coming up with all questions that you'll want to ask_

#### Make your pick according to your liking.

## From previous class, we have five (six) centralized group:
  
  - Fashion | Games (Film-making): possibly expanding to two groups
  - Project Manager
  - Scientists | Academics | Professors
  - Curator | Museum Business
  - Designers

## Task of the day 1

  1. Find your initial team mates;
  2. work out an initial list (excel/Google Sheet) version of top 3 candidates;
  3. You have 15 minutes;
  4. You are not expected to go very deep with social engineering, but 
  5. Selection of candidates should be justified through the excel;
  5. Possible columns can be why you picked them, start project, most recent interview, etc. and preference rank.

# Methodology (Due 11:59 AM Mar 31st)

## Circling back to Methodology Examples in Google Drive

- Refer to W8 folder
- Refer to the two papers for methodology framework inspirations aka 'formatting'
  - "Stuck in the stack" & "Air vs. MRT"
  - What level of details did these papers ended up providing in their methodology section?
  - Are they connected somehow to the literature review/background+introduction sections as well?
  - _But what if my methodologies are not natural-science-related?_
- Tutorial/Instruction Manual-like spirit

## Why do people have write a methodology section in research papers?
  - We previously discussed **what** are the typical methodologies out there that supports research as a given.
  - Reserach is ultimately meant for pushing boundaries:
    - 'dissemination'  (dissemination)
      - clarify extent and specifics of the published work
    - '**reproducible**' (repeatable)
      - allow readers to repeat the publication

## Double-check your submission to make sure that it can be considered a followable instruction manual by the domain experts.

# Data Visualization

## Question received last week

- How to use coding to do data visualization?
  - By programming language:
    - Python, R, Javascript (Processing/Arduino)
  - By type of programming:
    - (Text-based) Programming
    - Graphical/Visual/Block-based programming: Grasshopper
- How does data visualization differ in commercial vs. academic/research settings
  - Commercial:
    - Goal: Support decision-making
    - Designed to deliver messages
  - Academic:
    - Goal: Present evidence and analysis alongside findings
    - Designed to present evidence

## Visualizing Quantitative Data

- How do you usually work with them?
- What do you think are your biggest strength in treating them? Color Pallete and aethetics plus readability
- Types of data that can be visualized:
  - Numerical
  - Categorical
  - Text (Free text)
  - _Tabular_: multi-dimensional combined as above

## Time Series Data
  - Adding one more dimension
  - Time-stamped information, usually numerical
  - Scale of time series often important, similar to (potentially necessary) smoothing

## Sankey Diagram
  - Inflow/Outflow
  - Numerical Data that traces back to the source
  - Programmable yet messy in execution
