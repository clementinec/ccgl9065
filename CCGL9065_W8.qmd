Last week's strategy: **The Pre-Mortem**

*Assume you failed. Now fix it.*

**Anyone try it?** Did you imagine your argument bombing and then strengthen the weak points?

## Something You Took Away Last Week

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8;"}
Week 7 taught you about **narrative power** — who controls the story controls the future.

The Hockey Stick Graph, Climategate, moon landing conspiracies — you saw how facts can be manufactured, distorted, or weaponised depending on who's telling the story and why.

**Epistemic humility:** the recognition that what you "know" depends on who collected the data and who framed the question.

Now apply that lens to the biggest thing on Earth that most people never think about.

## From Contested Truth → Invisible Infrastructure

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8;"}
Last week: *"What if the truth itself is contested?"*

This week: *"What if the most important system on Earth is one you can't even see?"*

**The ocean.**

It covers 71% of the planet. It absorbs 30% of our CO₂. It traps 90% of excess heat. And the way we study it — who gets to research it, who profits from it, whose knowledge counts — is shaped by the same power structures you studied last week.

*"The critical [state of the oceans]{style="color: #e74c3c;"} and the intersection of [marine science]{style="color: #e74c3c;"}, [colonial legacies]{style="color: #e74c3c;"}, and [indigenous knowledge]{style="color: #e74c3c;"}."*

## Wait, What?

::: {style="font-size: 2.0em; text-align: center; padding: 40px; background: #0a3d62; color: white; border-radius: 15px;"}
The ocean covers [**71%**]{style="color: #3498db;"} of Earth's surface.

It circulates [**83%**]{style="color: #3498db;"} of global CO₂.

It absorbs [**30%**]{style="color: #3498db;"} of our CO₂ emissions.

It traps [**90%**]{style="color: #3498db;"} of excess greenhouse heat.

# The Ocean's Plight

## Two Crises, One System

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**1. Climate Regulation Under Threat**

- The ocean is the planet's thermostat — absorbing solar radiation, sequestering carbon, regulating weather
- But it's reaching saturation: ocean acidification, warming currents, disrupted circulation patterns
- Vulnerability to overexploitation is accelerating

**2. Biodiversity Loss**

- Plastic pollution — 400 million tonnes produced each year
- Coral reef degradation — affecting the 0.5 billion people who depend on them
- Decline in marine biodiversity — cascading through global ecosystems
:::

---

## Coral Reefs: The Rainforests of the Sea

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8; background: #0a3d62; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 15px;"}
**Coral reefs** protect coastlines from storms and erosion, provide jobs for local communities, and offer opportunities for recreation.

Over [**0.5 Billion people**]{style="color: #e74c3c;"} depend on reefs for food, income and protection. (NOAA)

Losing the coral reefs is not only losing coastal line/development and the job opportunity — it will be an **economic disaster.**
:::

# Anthropogenic Plastic

---

## The Numbers Are Staggering

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
- **Synthetic organic polymer** made from petroleum
- Over **400 million tonnes** produced each year
- Sources: stormwater runoff, sewer overflows, littering, inadequate waste management, industrial activities, tyre abrasion, construction, illegal dumping
- Breaks down into **microplastics** (≤ 5mm) under UV light
  - Found in **human blood**
  - Possible biomagnification up the food chain
- Degrades over **hundreds to thousands of years**
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 20px; background: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; text-align: center;"}

*Kurzgesagt (~9 min). The scale of plastic pollution made visceral. The twist: the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is invisible — it's a "plastic soup" of microparticles, not a floating island.*

## One Image. One Fact.

::: {style="font-size: 3em; text-align: center; padding: 80px; background: #0a3d62; color: white; border-radius: 15px;"}
[**46%**]{style="color: #e74c3c;"} of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch

is **fishing nets.**

# The Great Pacific Garbage Patch

---

## Not What You Think It Is

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8;"}
The world's largest collection of floating trash — "larger than Texas."

But here's what most people get wrong:

- **94%** of it is microplastics — you can't see most of it
- **46%** of the patch (by tonnage) is **fishing nets** — not plastic bags or bottles
- [**Consumer plastics are NOT the #1 culprit**]{style="color: #e74c3c; font-weight: bold;"}

A sea of plastic that will not grow smaller.
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; margin-top: 20px; background: #f9e79f; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;"}
This is epistemic humility in action: what you *think* the problem is (consumer waste) isn't actually the biggest contributor (industrial fishing gear). **The narrative shapes the policy.**

# Who Gets to Study the Ocean?

---

## Status-Quo & Issues With Marine Research

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Why studying and protecting the ocean is particularly difficult:**

- High costs & tech demands
- Natural challenges from ocean-based, observation-driven research
- Research output dominated by **G7 countries** (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK, USA)
- China rose post-2010 to follow USA
- **Extractive model**: resources and data extracted, often **without fair compensation or involvement** of local communities

**Colonial Legacies Unkept:**

- Less-resourced waters perpetuate colonial dynamics
- Western scientific approaches viewed as superior to indigenous ones
:::

---

## Rethinking Marine Research

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Historical Context:** Ocean exploration in less financially-resourced regions has focused on **extracting resources or data**, often without fair compensation or involvement of local communities.

**Marginalization of Indigenous Knowledge:**

- Indigenous peoples have a deep understanding of marine environments developed over millennia
- Often overlooked or undervalued by mainstream marine science

**How to Decolonize Ocean Science?**

- Inclusive Research Collaborations
- Benefit Sharing
- Integrating Knowledge Systems
- Policy and Governance reform
- Education and Capacity Building
:::

---

## Examples of Decolonized Research

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Community-Based Monitoring:**

- In the Arctic, Inuit communities have been involved in **monitoring sea ice changes**, combining traditional knowledge with scientific methods to track climate change impacts.

**Co-Managed Marine Protected Areas:**

- In the Pacific Islands, marine protected areas are **co-managed by indigenous communities** and governments, blending traditional conservation practices with scientific research.

**Coral Reef Restoration:**

- In the Caribbean, **local and indigenous practices** in managing fisheries and protecting marine habitats are integrated into coral reef restoration projects.

## Overfishing in Hong Kong

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Historical Fishing Grounds:**

- Once rich, Hong Kong's surrounding waters have seen a significant decline in fish populations due to overfishing

**Modern Pressures:**

- The rise in **commercial fishing practices**, coupled with **increased demand** from the city's population, exacerbates the problem

**Biodiversity Loss:**

- Key species have been depleted, affecting the marine ecosystem's balance and resilience
- Potential cuts to obvious traditional food options (fish balls)

**Indigenous Fishermen Knowledge:**

- Local fishermen possess **generational knowledge** on sustainable fishing practices, seasonal cycles, and the behaviour of local fish populations — unbeknownst to commercial fishing operations
- **Observational Insights:** Recognising early signs of ecosystem changes or stress
:::

---

## Overfishing in Hong Kong: Solutions

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Connecting Indigenous Knowledge and Overfishing Solutions:**

- **Collaborative Management** — fishermen + scientists + government
- **No-Take Zones** — areas where fishing is prohibited to allow recovery
- **Seasonal Restrictions** — following traditional knowledge of breeding cycles
- **Sustainable Techniques** — traditional methods over industrial trawling

**Challenges and Opportunities:**

- **Regulatory Integration** — policies should reflect on-the-ground realities
- **Cultural and Knowledge Preservation** — before it's lost
- **Community Involvement** — local fishing communities in decision-making fosters stewardship

## This Week's Debate Motion

::: {style="font-size: 2em; text-align: center; background: #2c3e50; color: white; padding: 50px; border-radius: 15px;"}
**"This house believes that Hong Kong should integrate indigenous fishermen's knowledge into its marine conservation policy, even where it contradicts conventional scientific recommendations."**
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-top: 30px; text-align: center;"}
PRO-CLIMATE: Local knowledge is irreplaceable data. Ignoring it is colonial thinking.

PRO-DEVELOPMENT: Anecdotal knowledge can't replace rigorous, reproducible science.

# Role-Play Activity: Decolonizing Ocean Science

---

## Embracing Perspectives

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**What We Are Doing:**

A **role-play activity** simulating a debate around **Decolonizing Ocean Science** within the Hong Kong context.

You will assume roles: **Pro-CC** and **Anti-CC** viewpoints, as well as **stakeholder positions** (Local Fishermen, Marine Scientists, Policy Makers, Conservation NGOs — or whatever you see fit).

**Why We Are Doing It:**

- To **explore diverse perspectives** on issues intersecting ocean conservation, traditional knowledge, and modern science
- To understand the **implications** of policy decisions on different communities
- To foster **empathy and critical thinking** by stepping into others' shoes
:::

---

## Ground Rules

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8;"}
- This is a [**safe space**]{style="color: #27ae60;"} for exploration and discussion. There are [**no wrong answers**]{style="color: #e74c3c;"}, only opportunities to learn.

- **Respect** and **open-mindedness** are our guiding principles. Every opinion shared contributes to collective learning.

- **Feedback** and **reflection** are encouraged. This is a chance to voice thoughts, ask questions, and grow from the experience.

## Pro-Climate / Pro-Decolonization Talking Points {.smaller}

::: {style="font-size: 1.3em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Progressive Actions to Address Climate Change:**

- **Urgent integration** of indigenous knowledge on par with scientific data for holistic ocean conservation
- **Drastic policy reforms** recognising indigenous rights and community leadership in marine resource management
- **Adoption of inclusive research models** that disrupt traditional hierarchies and empower local communities
- **Economic redistribution** to ensure equitable benefits from marine resources for indigenous and local communities
:::

---

## Pro-Development / Pro-Traditional Science Talking Points {.smaller}

::: {style="font-size: 1.3em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Pragmatic Approaches to Ocean Management:**

- **Peer-reviewed science** must remain the foundation of policy — anecdotal knowledge has limitations
- **Scalable technology** (satellite monitoring, AI-driven fish stock modelling) is more efficient than community-based methods
- **Economic stability** of fishing industries supports millions of livelihoods — abrupt restrictions cause harm
- **International coordination** through established scientific bodies is more effective than fragmented local governance
- **Hong Kong's food security** depends on reliable supply chains, not romanticised traditional practices

# This Week's Conceptual Takeaway

---

## What You Can't See Still Matters Most

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8; background: #0a3d62; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 15px;"}
Before this week, "climate change" might have felt like a *land* problem — cities, farms, factories.

Now you know: the **ocean is the planet's invisible life support.**

- It absorbs our CO₂ (30%)
- It traps our heat (90%)
- It feeds half a billion people through reefs alone
- And the way we study it replicates the power structures that caused the crisis
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; margin-top: 30px; font-weight: bold; color: #8e44ad; text-align: center;"}
**Your portable takeaway:** Invisible infrastructure — what you can't see is doing the heavy lifting. And who gets to see it is a political question.

# The Persuasion Playbook | Strategy #7

---

## The Fork

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; background: #2c3e50; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px;"}
*"Are you going to let your family suffer, or are you going to act now?"*

The trick isn't the answer.

**The trick is that both options accept your frame.**
:::

---

## The Science

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
This is the **False Dilemma** — or in sales, **The Fork**.

Present two choices that both serve your goal.

*"Do you want the red one or the blue one?"*
(Not: "Do you want to buy a car?")

The brain loves binary choices. Multiple options = paralysis.

**Two options = decision.**
:::

---

## You Just Saw It

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
When someone said:

*"We can either regulate AI now, or let corporations decide for us."*

Notice what's missing?

**"Do nothing" wasn't an option.** Because they didn't put it there.

## Next Week's Challenge

::: {style="font-size: 2em; background: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px; text-align: center;"}
**End with two options — both of which support your case.**

Remove the third option before they think of it.
