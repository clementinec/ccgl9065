## 1: Revisiting Progress - At What Cost?

#### Introduction to Modern Progress:
- Equating progress with industrial growth, tech advancements, and urban expansion.
- Environmental costs often overlooked.
- Key question: "What environmental losses have we accepted for progress?"

#### Example 1: Deforestation in the Amazon:
- Accelerated deforestation post-2010s for agriculture.
- Impact: Loss of biodiversity, carbon storage, and indigenous habitats.
- Trade-off: Global food supply vs. ecological preservation.

#### Example 2: Urbanization of Green Spaces:
- Cities like Jakarta and Beijing expanding into green areas.
- Impact: Loss of natural spaces vital for air quality and biodiversity.
- Trade-off: Economic growth and housing vs. green space conservation.

#### Example 3: Intensive Energy Extraction:
- Shale gas boom, especially in the U.S., post-2010s.
- Impact: Groundwater contamination, seismic activity, methane emissions.
- Trade-off: Energy independence vs. environmental health.

## 2: Beyond CO2 - The Potent Greenhouse Gas Threat

#### The Methane Concern:
- **Methane's Potency**: Methane (CH4) is over 25 times more potent than CO2 in trapping heat in the atmosphere over a 100-year period.
- **Permafrost Thaw**: Recent observations reveal accelerating permafrost thaw in the Arctic, unlocking vast methane reserves.
- **Impact**: Methane release from permafrost could significantly amplify global warming, contributing to a feedback loop.

#### Other Potent Gases:
- **Nitrous Oxide (N2O)**: Emissions from agricultural activities, particularly fertilizer use, have been rising, with N2O being about 300 times more potent than CO2.
- **Industrial Gases**: Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), used in air conditioning and refrigeration, have thousands of times the global warming potential of CO2.

## 2.1: Beyond CO2 - The Potent Greenhouse Gas Threat (Cont'd)

#### IPCC Models and Tipping Points:
- **Inclusion in Models**: The IPCC has recently integrated permafrost melt and methane release into their climate models, highlighting the urgency of the issue.
- **Tipping Point Concerns**: There's growing scientific consensus that we might be nearing or have crossed climate "tipping points," leading to irreversible changes.

#### Examples and Analogies:
- **Siberian Craters**: The discovery of massive craters in Siberia, believed to be caused by methane explosions from thawing permafrost, serves as a vivid illustration of the methane threat.
- **The Ice-Albedo Feedback**: As Arctic ice melts, it reveals darker water that absorbs more heat, further accelerating ice melt and methane release from permafrost - a dangerous feedback loop.

#### Reflection:
- The rising threat of potent greenhouse gases challenges us to look beyond CO2 in our climate change mitigation strategies.
- Understanding and addressing these less-discussed but highly impactful gases is crucial in our broader fight against global warming.


## 3: Geoengineering - A Symptomatic Treatment?

#### The Shift to Geoengineering:
- Large-scale interventions in Earth's systems
- Focus shifts from emission causes to climate symptoms management

#### Key Approaches:
- **Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)**:
  - Removes CO2 from the atmosphere
  - Stores it underground
- **Solar Radiation Management (SRM)**:
  - Reflects sunlight away
  - Aims to reduce global warming

#### Ethical and Practical Concerns:
- **Unintended Consequences**:
  - Risk of unforeseen side effects
  - Potential to worsen climate issues
- **Moral Hazard**:
  - Might reduce urgency for emission cuts
  - Reliance on technological fixes

## 4: Questioning "Progress" and "Modernity"

## 5.2 Understanding System Thinking in Environmental Context

### What is Systems Thinking?
  - **Holistic Perspective:** Complex systems as interconnected wholes
  - **Feedback Loops**: Recognizing how different elements within a system influence one another, non-linear

### Interconnectivity in Nature
  - Interaction of ecosystem
  - Climate phenomena as result of interactions wtihin and between atmosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere and biosphere

### Understanding System Thinking
  - Empowers you to see the bigger picture and recognize the ripple effects of actions
  - Encourages innovative and holistic solutions to environmental challenges through interconnectedness

## 6: Urgent Climate Issues We Cannot Ignore

#### Rising Sea Levels:
- Coastal erosion and flooding
- Threatens communities and infrastructure

#### Biodiversity Loss:
- Ecosystem collapse and species extinction
- Undermines Earth's life support systems
