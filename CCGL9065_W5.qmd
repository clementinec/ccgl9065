# Last Week's Strategy: Sensory Hijack

---

## Quick Callback

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
Last week's strategy: **Sensory Hijack**

*The body believes what the mind resists.*

**Anyone try it?** Did you make your audience physically uncomfortable — on purpose?
:::

---

## Something You Took Away Last Week

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8;"}
Week 4 gave you a new lens: **timing changes everything.**

The Duck Curve showed you that solar energy isn't just about *how much* — it's about *when.*

- The sun shines when you don't need power.
- Demand peaks exactly when supply drops.
- A "clean" grid can collapse if you ignore the clock.
:::

System boundaries aren't just spatial — they're **temporal.** And that matters even more when you scale up to cities.
:::

## From Energy Grids → The Built Environment

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8;"}
Last week: *"When does the energy flow?"*

This week: *"What did we build — and what does it cost the planet?"*

**Same systems thinking. Biggest system boundary yet.**

A city is the ultimate system — energy, water, waste, transport, people — all interacting inside a boundary of concrete and glass that traps heat, consumes resources, and reshapes the climate around it.

# But First: A Number That Should Bother You

---

## Wait, What?

::: {style="font-size: 2.2em; text-align: center; padding: 40px; background: #1a1a2e; color: white; border-radius: 15px;"}
Cities cover just [**3%**]{style="color: #e74c3c;"} of the Earth's land surface.

They produce [**over 70%**]{style="color: #e74c3c;"} of global CO₂ emissions.

And consume [**78%**]{style="color: #e74c3c;"} of the world's energy.
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; text-align: center; margin-top: 30px;"}
**The built environment isn't just affected by climate change. It's *driving* it.**
:::

---

## More Numbers That Don't Add Up

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 2.0;"}
- By 2050, [**68%**]{style="color: #e74c3c;"} of the world's population will live in cities (UN)

- NYC's Central Park can be [**up to 5°C cooler**]{style="color: #3498db;"} than the streets just 200 metres away — same day, same city

- Vienna turns [**250,000 tonnes of garbage**]{style="color: #27ae60;"} into heat for 60,000 homes — in a building designed by an artist

- Hong Kong buildings account for [**over 60%**]{style="color: #e74c3c;"} of the city's electricity consumption — and [**90%**]{style="color: #e74c3c;"} of that electricity comes from fossil fuels
:::

# Anthropogenic Behaviour

---

## A Word You Already Know

::: {style="font-size: 1.8em; line-height: 1.8;"}
[**Anthropogenic**]{style="color: #c0392b; font-size: 1.2em;"}: of, relating to, or resulting from the influence of human beings on nature.

You've heard this in Week 2 (food systems), Week 3 (fashion), Week 4 (energy).

But this week it becomes *architectural*. The question isn't just what we consume — it's **what we build.**

::: {style="width: 55%;"}
::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Metropolis** (1927)

A film set in the year **2026.**

That's... *this year.*

Fritz Lang imagined a city of towering skyscrapers, underground workers, and a society split between those who plan and those who labour.

**How wrong was he?**

## What Makes a Metropolis?

::: {style="font-size: 1.3em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Characteristics:**

- High population density
- Diverse cultural and economic activities
- Complex infrastructure systems
- Unique blend of modern and traditional architecture
- Hub for innovation, entrepreneurship, and creativity
- Centre for education, healthcare, and entertainment

**Challenges:**

- Traffic congestion and air pollution
- Inadequate housing and overcrowding
- Strain on public services and infrastructure
- Affordability crises
- **Reverse Urbanization** — the suburban pull
:::

---

## Why Does ANYBODY Want to Stay?

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
- **Economic Opportunities**: Jobs, pay grades, larger talent pool, startup ecosystems
- **Cultural Diversity & Entertainment**: Theatre, museums, people
- **Education & Research**: Universities, institutions
- **Infrastructure & Transportation**: Connectivity
- **Networking & Collaboration**: Proximity = opportunity
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 20px; background: #2c3e50; color: white; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;"}
**The metropolis is a climate problem *and* a climate solution.** That's the paradox.
:::

---

## Reverse Urbanization

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Definition**: The process of metropolitan residents moving *out.*

**Known causes:**

- Housing affordability
- High cost of living
- Crowdedness

**Impact:**

- Shift in population dynamics
- Growth in smaller cities and towns
- [**What does it mean for the metropolis?**]{style="color: #f1c40f;"}
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-top: 20px; font-style: italic;"}
When people flee cities, does the climate problem follow them — or just spread out?

# The Climate Footprint of a City

## {background-color="#1a1a2e"}

::: {style="font-size: 2em; color: white; line-height: 1.6; font-style: italic;"}
"A city is not an accident but the result of coherent visions and aims."
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; color: #95a5a6; margin-top: 30px;"}
— Léon Krier, *The Architecture of Community*, Island Press, 2009
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; color: #e74c3c; margin-top: 20px; font-weight: bold;"}
If the city is designed, then its climate footprint is designed too. By us.
:::

---

## Urban Heat Island: The Invisible Architecture

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8; background: #1a1a2e; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 15px;"}
Every surface you see in a city — **concrete, glass, asphalt, steel** — absorbs heat during the day and radiates it at night.

This makes metropolitan areas [**1–3°C hotter**]{style="color: #e74c3c;"} than surrounding rural areas.

That's not weather. That's **architecture.**
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; margin-top: 30px; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"}
This is the **Urban Heat Island** (UHI) effect — and it's why your city is literally hotter than the countryside.
:::

---

## Why UHI Matters More Than You Think

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
It's not just discomfort. The UHI effect triggers a **cascade**:

1. **Higher temperatures** → more air conditioning demand
2. **More AC** → more electricity consumption
3. **More electricity** → more fossil fuel burning (remember: HK is 90% fossil-powered)
4. **More burning** → more heat → [**the city gets even hotter**]{style="color: #e74c3c;"}

This is a **positive feedback loop.** The hotter the city gets, the more energy it uses to cool down, which makes it hotter.
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 20px; background: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; text-align: center;"}
**UHI is Week 10's "systems thinking" in miniature.** Remember this when we get there.

*Vox (~7 min). Thermal cameras reveal Phoenix's UHI. The twist: wealthy neighbourhoods are cooler than poor ones. Heat is an inequality problem.*

## One Image. One Number.

[**3%**]{style="color: #e74c3c;"} of land.

[**70%**]{style="color: #e74c3c;"} of CO₂.

That's cities. That's *us.*

## Metropolis & Climate Change

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
Five ways growing architecture affects climate:

| Impact | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Urban Heat Island** | Concrete & glass trap heat; cities 1–3°C hotter |
| **Energy Consumption** | Per capita energy demand concentrates in cities |
| **Transportation Emissions** | Cities as logistics hubs — commuting, freight |
| **Waste Management** | More waste per area; burning → GHG; landfills → methane |
| **Water Scarcity** | Large, concentrated demands strain supply |

# Case Study 1: New York City

---

## {background-color="black"}

![Central Park from above — a 3.4 km² green rectangle holding back the heat of Manhattan.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Global_Citizen_Festival_Central_Park_New_York_City_from_NYonAir_%2815351915006%29.jpg/1280px-Global_Citizen_Festival_Central_Park_New_York_City_from_NYonAir_%2815351915006%29.jpg){width="85%"}

---

## The Paradox of Central Park

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8;"}
NYC's population has remained relatively steady despite everything — because of:

- **Diverse economy** (finance, tech, creative industries)
- **World-class cultural offerings** (museums, Broadway, food)
- **Continued investment** in infrastructure and public services

The city continues to attract people due to its unique combination of known and unknown opportunity.
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; margin-top: 20px; background: #27ae60; color: white; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;"}
But here's the thing: NYC's Central Park — 3.4 km² of green — drops the temperature around it by up to **5°C** compared to Midtown. **One park. Five degrees.**

# Waste-to-Energy: Turning the Problem Into the Solution

---

## WtE: Harvesting Energy From Anthropogenic Activity

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**How it works:**

- Converts solid waste materials into usable energy
- Combustion/thermal treatment of waste
- Heat produces steam → drives turbines → generates electricity

**Why it matters:**

- Worldwide WtE market to reach **USD $66 billion by 2032** (Spherical Insights, 2023)
- Recovers resources, reduces landfill use (methane drop)
- Reduces reliance on fossil fuels
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-top: 20px; font-style: italic;"}
But is burning waste really "clean"? That depends on where you draw the system boundary. (Sound familiar?)

- Generates **60 GWh** of electricity
- Produces **500 GWh** of district heating
- Heats **~60,000 Viennese homes**

## When a Metropolis Runs Dry

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
LA's approach to water scarcity — a preview of what many cities will face:

- **TIP 1:** Leverage to save water *while* using water (efficiency at point of use)
- **TIP 2:** Limit/stop using water under certain scenarios (restrictions)
- **TIP 3:** Free government service to audit your private water system
- **TIP 4:** Rebate for changing landscaping to drought-tolerant plants ("Cash for Grass")
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-top: 20px; font-style: italic;"}
Notice: these are a mix of individual behaviour change and structural incentives. That tension will explode in Week 6 when we talk about capitalism.

# This Week's Conceptual Takeaway

---

## The Built Environment Is a Climate Actor

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8; background: #1a1a2e; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 15px;"}
Before this week, "climate change" might have felt like an *atmosphere* problem.

Now you know: **every building is a climate decision.**

- What it's made of (concrete = 8% of global CO₂)
- How it's cooled (AC → fossil fuels → more heat)
- Where it's placed (UHI feedback loop)
- What happens to its waste (landfill vs. WtE)
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; margin-top: 30px; font-weight: bold; color: #8e44ad; text-align: center;"}
**Your portable takeaway:** The built environment isn't background — it's the biggest system boundary we've seen yet.

## The Anchoring Trap

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; background: #2c3e50; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px;"}
Realtors show you a terrible, overpriced house **first**.

The second house — still overpriced — looks reasonable.

**You don't evaluate houses. You evaluate differences from the anchor.**
:::

---

## The Science

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
This is **Anchoring** (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).

The first number you hear distorts all subsequent judgment — even when it's obviously irrelevant.

In experiments, people estimated higher values after spinning a **random wheel** with higher numbers.

**The brain cannot ignore the anchor.**
:::

---

## You Just Saw It

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
When someone opened with an extreme number:

*"AI could consume 30% of global electricity by 2040. Even the conservative estimate is 12%."*

Now 12% sounds reasonable. But 12% is still catastrophic.

**The anchor did its job.**
:::

## Next Week's Challenge

::: {style="font-size: 2em; background: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px; text-align: center;"}
**Lead with the extreme. Then offer the "reasonable" version.**

Set the anchor before they do.
