## The Prompt

Create an artifact using GenAI—visual, written, or hybrid.

Your submission must include three parts:

### 1. The Artifact

A designed or written piece that demonstrates your engagement with AI.

Format is open: poster, document, website, video, whatever fits your work.

### 2. Annotation (500-800 words)

A written reflection that answers:

- **What did the AI want to give you?**
  Describe the default, the average, the path of least resistance.

- **What did you make it give you instead?**
  Where did you push, redirect, override?

- **What risks did you navigate?**
  Identify at least two:
  - Legal (copyright, IP, liability)
  - Regulatory (institutional rules, platform terms)
  - Moral/ethical (harm, deception, manipulation)
  - Creative (convergence, mediocrity, losing your voice)

- **Where is the line?**
  Point to specific moments in your artifact where AI's contribution ends and yours begins.

### 3. Evidence

Include at least one screenshot or transcript showing a moment of friction, resistance, or divergence in your process.

## What We Grade

### We are NOT grading:

- Polish
- Technical sophistication
- "Correct" use of AI

### We ARE grading:

| Criterion | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Deliberateness** | Did you make choices, or did you accept defaults? |
| **Awareness** | Can you name the risks you navigated? |
| **Divergence** | Is there something here that couldn't have come from the machine alone? |
| **Honesty** | Do you know where the AI ends and you begin? |

---

## Rubric

| Criterion | Excellent | Adequate | Insufficient |
|-----------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **Deliberateness** | Clear, specific choices documented; knows why | Some choices documented, vague on reasons | Accepted defaults; no evidence of choice |
| **Risk Awareness** | Names multiple risk types; nuanced navigation | Names risks but superficially | No risk awareness |
| **Divergence** | Clear moments where AI was overridden; artifact couldn't exist without human input | Some divergence but mild | Artifact is indistinguishable from raw AI output |
| **Honesty** | Precise about where AI ends and human begins | Somewhat clear | Boundary is unclear or hidden |

---

## Submission

**Format:** Open—poster, document, website, video, whatever fits the artifact.

Annotation can be embedded in the artifact or submitted separately.

**Deadline:** [TBD]

---

## The Standard

The goal is not "use AI well."

The goal is **prove you're not redundant.**
