## What This Module Is

Standard AI courses teach: *"Here's how to use AI responsibly."*

This module teaches something different: **AI has no responsibility. It has no agency. It has no originality. It only has patterns.**

Your job is to understand its walls, break through them, and make it answer to you—or disappear into the average.

## The Arc

| Class | Title | What Happens | What You Learn |
|-------|-------|--------------|----------------|
| 1 | [Walls & Friction](class1.html) | You discover what AI resists | "Someone built constraints into this" |
| 2 | [Breaking Through](class2.html) | You bypass guardrails, witness hallucinations | "The constraints are external and leaky. AI has no internal commitment to anything." |
| 3 | [Your Signature](class3.html) | You create something that couldn't come from the machine alone | "AI follows patterns. If I don't fight, I become average. The responsibility is mine." |

## What I'm Asking You to Do

I'm not asking you to learn "best practices." I'm asking you to:

1. **Find the walls.** Discover where AI resists, hedges, refuses, or slows down.
2. **Break through.** See what's behind the guardrails. (Spoiler: nothing. No values. No conviction. Just patterns.)
3. **Fight the current.** Create something that proves you're not redundant.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Identify four types of risk in AI use: legal, regulatory, moral/ethical, and creative
2. Demonstrate through direct experience that AI guardrails are external impositions, not internal values
3. Articulate why AI outputs tend toward convergence/average
4. Make deliberate choices about when to respect, navigate, or push against AI constraints
5. Produce creative work that demonstrates personal divergence from AI defaults

## How You'll Be Assessed

We do not grade polish. We grade **deliberateness**.

The goal is not "use AI well." The goal is "prove you're not redundant."
