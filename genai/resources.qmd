## Cases to Know

### Harm & Safety

- Character.AI incidents — chatbot relationships, user harm
- Chatbot manipulation cases — users tricked into harmful actions

### Intellectual Property

- Getty Images v. Stability AI — training data copyright
- New York Times v. OpenAI — content reproduction

### Deepfakes & Misinformation

## On Convergence & Creativity

- Alex Murrell, ["The Age of Average"](https://www.alexmurrell.co.uk/articles/the-age-of-average) — Excellent piece on algorithmic homogenization and why everything looks the same now.
- Ted Chiang, ["ChatGPT Is a Blurry JPEG of the Web"](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web) — The New Yorker. Influential but [technically contested](https://domenic.me/chatgpt-simulacrum/): critics argue LLMs are simulators, not compressors, and the analogy mischaracterizes how they work. Read critically.

## A Note

These resources are starting points, not comprehensive coverage.

The landscape changes fast. Cases from six months ago are already outdated.

Your job is to stay aware—not to memorize a static list.
