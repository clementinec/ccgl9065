## 👋 About Me

- Started as an engineering undergrad curious about people and buildings
- Turned PhD obsession into real-world tools for climate resilience
- I love: thermal imaging, city data, and solving puzzles that matter

---

## 🧪 What is Research, Really?

::: {.block}
**Not just lab coats and microscopes**

Research = asking big questions *no one knows the answer to yet* and building tools, models, or arguments to explore those questions.
:::

- For me? It means using data, physics, and AI to fix how buildings behave.
- Let's start from perhaps how this journey started.

## 🎓 My Academic Journey

![Timeline](TC DB_Sharing/ab.png)

- BEng in Mechanical/Architectural Engineering @ HIT
- MSc in Mechanical Engineering @ Columbia & CMU
- PhD in Architecture @ Princeton
  - _Thermal Comfort in Naturally Ventilated Buildings_
- Data Scientist @ BNY Mellon & now Assistant Professor @ HKU

### 🧠 What I Study: Starting from Mean Radiant Temperature

![Research Pillars](TC DB_Sharing/overall heatmap.png)

- **Thermal Comfort** – how people feel hot/cold across cultures 🌏
- **Building Controls** – smarter thermostats using AI 🧠
- **Urban Analysis** – thermal drones + city maps 🏙️

---

#### 🔥 Global Thermal Comfort: East Meets West

![Heatmap of Comfort Data](TC DB_Sharing/Heatmap_All_new.jpg)

- 148,148 records across continents
- Cultural and physiological differences shape comfort

---

#### 🧍‍♀️ What Affects Comfort?

![Age Residuals](TC DB_Sharing/facet_age_residuals_new.jpg)

- Age, gender, and BMI matter more than standard models assume
- These are often ignored in building designs

---

## 🤖 Physics-Informed AI Models

![PINN-VAE Diagram](PINN-VAE/fig/PINN_VAE_Diagram.pdf)

- Combines neural networks with physical constraints
- Improves prediction accuracy with fewer assumptions

---

### 📈 PINN-VAE Results

![Thermal Neutral Accuracy](PINN-VAE/fig/mae_10.png)

- 8–11% improvement in thermal neutral zone prediction
- Robust against missing data

---

### 🏠 Smart Control Strategies

![Control Workflow](Comfort_EPlus_GridSearch/figs/gridworkflow_3.pdf)

- ML integrated with EnergyPlus
- Evaluated over multiple climate zones

---

### 🌍 Multi-City Comparison

![City Energy Comparison](Comfort_EPlus_GridSearch/figs/comparison_multi_city_vertical_enhanced.pdf)

- PMV vs LightGBM vs PINN-VAE
- Grid search = 15–18% energy savings

---

### 📊 Real-World Energy Savings

![Savings](Comfort_EPlus_GridSearch/figs/savings_r.png)

- Reduced discomfort from 25% to <3%
- Demonstrated consistent energy benefits

---

### 🌇 Urban Heat Mapping

![Thermal Map](Thermal Image Segmentation_ENE-3/img/Thermographic picture_legend.png)

- Cities like Turin assessed with drone thermal imagery
- Faster retrofitting with automated image analysis

---

### 🧠 Segmenting Buildings from Heat

![Thermal Segmentation Overlay](Thermal Image Segmentation_ENE-3/img/comparison_overlay_38.png)

- Used vision-language models (like CLIP + SAM)
- Detected and classified buildings accurately

---

## 🔬 Sensor Importance Study

![Top Sensors](sensemini/fig_top8.pdf)

- MRT is 1.5× more predictive than air temperature
- Used LightGBM + perturbation analysis

---

## 🎯 Simpler Can Be Smarter

![MRT Importance](sensemini/fig_mrt_ta_ratio.pdf)

- Fewer sensors, smarter setup
- Up to 70% accuracy with 6 inputs

---

## 🔍 What You See from a Quick Web Search

- "Assistant Professor at HKU Department of Architecture"
- "PhD from Princeton in Architectural Technology"
- "Patented technique in time series predictive analytics"
- "Gartner Eye on Innovation Award Americas 2020"
- "Research interests: Thermal Comfort, Building Control, AI"

## 🎯 What I Actually Do: Beyond the Bio

**The Real Work:** Using machine learning to extract insights from complex engineering datasets

- **148,000+ thermal comfort records** → Cultural patterns in human perception
- **Aerial thermal imagery** → Automated building energy assessments  
- **Sensor networks** → Smarter HVAC control with 15-18% energy savings
- **Physics + AI models** → Better predictions with fewer assumptions

## 💡 Summary of Key Points

- Data scale matters (148k records)
- AI + Physics beats black-box models
- Simple solutions sometimes outperform complex ones
- We can scale up from rooms to whole cities

## 🚀 Personal Development Tips for Future Researchers

![Skills Development](sensemini/Hist_icml.png)

1. **Master the fundamentals** – Psychrometrics, thermodynamics, heat transfer basics
2. **Python is your friend** – Start with data analysis, then move to ML libraries
3. **Keep your interests wide open** – Architecture + Engineering + AI = endless possibilities

::: {.fragment}
*Start small, think big, stay curious!*
