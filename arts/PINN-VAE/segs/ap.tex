\subsection{Data Alignment Table}\label{sec:alignment}
To provide better context of how the data alignment is performed across different columns and their correspoding fields of interests, we have included the table we used to map accordingly as showon in Table~\ref{tab:table-map}.

\subsection{Frozen PPI Weights}
While the Personalized Physiology Interface (PPI) header was introduced to leverage individual demographic data, its impact on overall performance (model \texttt{pvp\_pen}) yielded only marginal improvements compared to the standard PINN-VAE (\texttt{pv\_pen}), as seen in Table~\ref{tab:performance_updated} and Figure 6. Although the improvement was consistent, it was not deemed sufficiently notable within the scope of this preliminary exploration to warrant extensive discussion. Further investigation is needed to fully understand how to maximize the benefit of such personalization. Future work could explore enhancing the PPI by integrating dynamic data, such as real-time physiological measurements from wearable sensors, potentially unlocking more significant performance gains and adaptability.

%Add one more table and we're done.

Nevertheless, we were able to freeze the final PPI weights across our proposed header addition to the PINN-VAE framework, notably the PPI-ANALYTIC Model as outlined in Figure~\ref{fig:workflow}. As was discussed inside the results and discussion section of this paper, its improvement upon the PINN-VAE model was clear yet minimal. Hence this header architecture was not pursued any further beyond the following table with weights frozen.
