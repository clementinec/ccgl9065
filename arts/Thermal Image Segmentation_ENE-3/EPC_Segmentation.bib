	abstract = {This paper quantifies the long-term impact of wind energy development on electricity prices across the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors in the United States. Our data set is made up of state level panel data from 2000 through 2018. This time period covers the vast majority of total wind energy capacity installed in the history of the USA. Our econometric model accounts for the primary factors that influence electricity prices, incorporating both fixed effects and general method of moments in order to more precisely isolate the effect of wind energy. The empirical results conclude that wind energy is positively and significantly related to electricity prices across all sectors, as indicated by the higher average electricity prices in states with higher percentages of wind energy. The price increase is largest in the industrial sector, followed by commercial, then residential. Wind turbine technology has become significantly more efficient, but the technical gains have been offset by the increased indirect costs of incorporating wind energy into the grid. Transmission and balancing costs have increased the final price to consumers. Our results highlight the need to view wind energy development from a more holistic perspective that accounts for structural and systemic costs. This will ensure the continued growth of wind energy. These results provide relevant insight to help wind energy developers, policy makers, and utility companies build a more sustainable energy future.},

	abstract = {The residential energy demand is growing steadily and the trend is expected to continue in the near future. At the same time, under the impulse of economic crises and environmental and energy policies, many households have experienced reductions in real income and higher energy prices. In the residential sector, the number of fuel-poor households is thus expected to rise. A better understanding of the determinants of residential energy demand, in particular of the role of income and the sensitivity of households to changes in energy prices, is crucial in the context of recurrent debates on energy efficiency and fuel poverty.
We propose a panel threshold regression (PTR) model to empirically test the sensitivity of French households to energy price fluctuations—as measured by the elasticity of residential heating energy prices—and to analyze the overlap between their income and fuel poverty profiles. The PTR model allows to test for the non-linear effect of income on the reactions of households to fluctuations in energy prices. Thus, it can identify specific regimes differing by their level of estimated price elasticities. Each regime represents an elasticity-homogeneous group of households. The number of these regimes is determined based on an endogenously PTR-fixed income threshold. Thereafter, we analyze the composition of the regimes (i.e. groups) to locate the dominant proportion of fuel-poor households and analyse their monetary poverty characteristics.
Results show that, depending on the income level, we can identify two groups of households that react differently to residential energy price fluctuations and that fuel-poor households belong mostly to the group of households with the highest elasticity. By extension, results also show that income poverty does not necessarily mean fuel poverty.
In terms of public policy, we suggest focusing on income heterogeneity by considering different groups of households separately when defining energy efficiency measures. We also suggest paying particular attention to targeting fuel-poor households by examining the overlap between fuel and income poverty.},

This paper estimates a short-run residential electricity demand function to evaluate the distributional impact of the tariff increase. The analysis allows heterogeneity in households' price sensitivity and the model is estimated using a nationally representative sample of 8,572 Turkish households. The results suggest that rich households in Turkey are three times as responsive in adjusting consumption to price changes as poor households are. In addition, the welfare loss of the poorest income quintile—measured by the change in consumer surplus as a percentage of income—is 2.9 times that of the wealthiest.},

	abstract = {Energy poverty has been kept at bay in Sweden for the past decades owing to several beneficial circumstances. However, geopolitical pressure and an accelerating energy transition are changing the circumstances and exposing vulnerabilities to energy poverty in Sweden particularly connected to electricity price peaks. The circumstantial nature of the exposed risks for energy poverty motivates a conceptualisation of the concept in Sweden through the energy vulnerability framework. Also recognising that flexibility is an important ability to be able to dodge short-term price peaks, this paper combines the energy vulnerability literature with the concept of flexibility capital. Using national survey data from 2021, this study seeks to explore vulnerability to heating-related energy poverty in Swedish single-family housing by analysing factors influencing households' self-perceived ability to pay for heating as well as their self-perceived flexibility capital. Logistic regression models revealed that there are geographic as well as sociodemographic factors influencing the energy vulnerability experienced by Swedish households. Extending the understanding of energy poverty vulnerability beyond mere heating affordability provides a more nuanced understanding of the different types of risks that may emerge among households; for example, low affordability combined with low flexibility capital increases the risk for financial effects of energy poverty, whereas low affordability combined with high flexibility capital increases the risk for energy poverty affecting comfort, convenience and wellbeing. By integrating energy vulnerability with flexibility capital, this paper contributes to a more holistic understanding of challenges connected to a transitioning energy system in general and in the Swedish context in particular.
•Energy poverty emerged as an issue in Sweden as prices peaked at the end of 2021.•The energy vulnerability framework is used to account for changing circumstances.•Flexibility capital is added to describe households' ability to dodge price peaks.•Logistic regression is used to analyse national survey data from autumn 2021.•Sociodemographic and geographic factors affect energy vulnerability and flexibility.},

Accurate savings estimations are important to promote energy efficiency projects and demonstrate their cost-effectiveness. The increasing presence of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in commercial buildings has resulted in a rising availability of high frequency interval data. These data can be used for a variety of energy efficiency applications such as demand response, fault detection and diagnosis, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) optimization. This large amount of data has also opened the door to the use of advanced statistical learning models, which hold promise for providing accurate building baseline energy consumption predictions, and thus accurate saving estimations. The gradient boosting machine is a powerful machine learning algorithm that is gaining considerable traction in a wide range of data driven applications, such as ecology, computer vision, and biology. In the present work an energy consumption baseline modeling method based on a gradient boosting machine was proposed. To assess the performance of this method, a recently published testing procedure was used on a large dataset of 410 commercial buildings. The model training periods were varied and several prediction accuracy metrics were used to evaluate the model’s performance. The results show that using the gradient boosting machine model improved the R‐squared prediction accuracy and the CV(RMSE) in more than 80 percent of the cases, when compared to an industry best practice model that is based on piecewise linear regression, and to a random forest algorithm.},

In particular, the paper reviews the types of buildings, their characteristics, the type of energy predicted, the dataset, the artificial intelligence (AI) methods used for energy consumption prediction, and the implemented research evaluation performance measures. The review findings show that a small number of studies consider buildings' characteristics as predictors for energy consumption. Most of the studies use historical energy consumption data, i.e., time-series data, to predict future buildings' energy consumption. The present study contributes a new taxonomy of the most common AI methods used for energy consumption predictions based on buildings' characteristics. The study also provides a comparative analysis of the different AI methods in terms of their contributions regarding the prediction of energy consumption. The review identifies research gaps in the existing studies, which is used to highlight future research directions.

Although the energy certificate is intended to provide the characteristics of individual buildings, so stimulating the real estate market toward ever better energy performance, data management of the certificates issued over time, using a national or regional energy cadastre, makes available a data base which is useful for energy planning in the building sector. This paper provides the needed results of a benchmarking study on data from the energy cadastre of the Lombardy Region, northern Italy. By integrating data from the energy cadastre (175.778 energy certificates) with the statistical data obtained from the national census, indicators were obtained on the energy performance of existing buildings. The energy indicators obtained, characterised by building type and construction period, normalised as a function of Degree-Days, become an effective tool for energy planning at local and regional scales. In the specific case, the energy indicators have been used to estimate the potential for energy retrofit of existing buildings in the Lombardy Region. The same indicators can also be used by municipalities for energy planning at the municipal or district level.},

This study aims to develop, calibrate and validate an UBEM using available national data, including GIS-based property maps and energy performance certificates (EPCs). The developed UBEM offers an automated framework for constructing simple building-level models from open data and conducting energy simulations in EnergyPlus. The developed UBEM was calibrated and validated for two case study cities in Sweden, Borlänge and Uppsala, where the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between simulated results and EPC data was 26\% and 22\%, respectively. Furthermore, a downward trend was observed in the MAPE with increasing spatial aggregation from building to district and city levels (from 26\% to 21\% and 10\%), which highlights the performance of the UBEM in this study to support accurate urban-scale energy analyses for buildings.},

However, the process of issuing Swedish EPCs has received criticism from real estate agents, real estate owners, Energy Experts, and Boverket, the national agency responsible for EPC data collection. In order to use the EPC data for describing the building stock it is necessary to assess and remediate the data quality. This has been done by merging the EPC data with databases of the Housing and Urban Development office and one of the larger real estate companies in Sweden, Riksbyggen. The Swedish EPC specific area measurement, Atemp, is found to vary according to methods of derivation. The method of estimating Atemp is improved using a stepwise regression model (R2=0.979). This method can be applied to subsets of EPCs depending on the intended way of describing the building stock.},

	abstract = {Household energy consumption has been increasing in the last decades; the residential sector is responsible for about 40\% of the total final energy use in Europe. Energy efficiency measures can both reduce energy needs of buildings and energy-related CO2 emissions. For this reason, in recent years, the European Union has been making efforts to enhance energy saving in buildings by introducing various policies and strategies; in this context, a common methodology was developed to assess and to certify energy performance of buildings. The positive effects obtained by energy efficiency measures need to be verified, but measuring and monitoring building energy performance is time consuming and financially demanding. Alternatively, energy efficiency can also be evaluated by specific indicators based on energy consumption. In this work, a methodology to investigate the level of energy efficiency reached in the Umbria Region (Central Italy) is described, based on data collected by energy certificates. In fact, energy certificates, which are the outcomes of simulation models, represent a useful and available tool to collect data related to the energy use of dwellings. A database of building energy performance was developed, in which about 6500 energy certificates of residential buildings supplied by Umbria region were inserted. On the basis of this data collection, average energy and CO2 indicators related to the building heritage in Umbria were estimated and compared to national and international indicators derived from official sources. Results showed that the adopted methodology in this work  can be an alternative method for the evaluation of energy indicators; in fact, the ones calculated considering simulation data were similar to the ones reported in national and international sources. This allowed to validate the adopted methodology and the efficiency of European policies.},

	abstract = {Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) are intended to provide tenants and buyers with reliable information about the energy performance of buildings. As improved energy performance may increase building sale prices and rents, the EPCs are supposed to generate incentives for owners to invest in energy efficiency. The empirical evidence for a price premium associated with energy labels is, however, inconclusive and partly contradictory. By utilizing data from the Norwegian housing market, we reproduce the positive price premium effect found in earlier studies. However, when we check these results by taking advantage of the fact that the introduction of a mandatory energy certification system represents a quasi-natural experiment, we find no evidence of a price premium. On the contrary, we present evidence that there is no effect of the energy label itself.
•We study house prices before and after introduction of energy performance certification.•Houses with better energy certification are sold for higher price.•However, these houses were sold for higher price even before the certification existed.•We find no price premium associated with energy performance certificates.•Recommend to reevaluate the energy performance certification system for buildings.},

	abstract = {The Energy Performance of Buildings Directives (EPBDs) are political initiatives taken by the European Union to tackle the problems of climate change and security of energy supply. One of the key measures of these directives is the use of Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) to model the energy performance of housing. This research investigates whether the current calculation methodologies in use for the generation of EPCs in the Mediterranean are appropriate. The analysis was carried out by comparative testing using different national methodologies from Cyprus, Italy, Malta and Spain on four test case study dwellings. The test results were validated against the output from dynamic simulation software and against monitored temperature and energy data from the test case properties. Considerable differences in the outputs from the various national methodologies currently in use were found. It was concluded that several of the EPC calculation methodologies have not been calibrated against the energy profile representative of the national or regional building stock; accurate definition of the operating parameters for the heating and cooling system is particularly significant if a more precise prediction of the energy performance of the dwelling is required; and the underlying assumptions made by the national application of the EN ISO 13790 standard for the calculation of the energy use for space heating and cooling have a greater influence on the outputs from the certification methodology than the choice of calculation method. It is quite clear that calibration of the EPC methodology is essential for the certificates to provide an effective means of achieving the aims of the EPBD. However, at a conceptual level, the results from this research have also shown that the mild Mediterranean climate with its inherently low energy demand for residential space heating and cooling could justify a different regional approach to tackle the EPBD goals of reduction in carbon emissions and dependency on imported fuels.},

The model is designed and trained to be promptable, so it can transfer zero-shot to new image distributions and tasks. We evaluate its capabilities on numerous tasks and find that its zero-shot performance is impressive -- often competitive with or even superior to prior fully supervised results. We are releasing the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and corresponding dataset (SA-1B) of 1B masks and 11M images at https://segment-anything.com to foster research into foundation models for computer vision.},

	abstract = {Stakeholders such as urban planners and energy policymakers use building energy performance modeling and analysis to develop strategic sustainable energy plans with the aim of reducing energy consumption and emissions from the built environment. However, inconsistent energy data and the lack of scalable building models create a gap between building energy modeling and traditional planning practices. An alternative approach is to conduct a large-scale energy usage survey, which is time-consuming. Similarly, existing studies rely on traditional machine learning or statistical approaches for calculating large-scale energy performance. This paper proposes a solution that employs a data-driven machine learning approach to predict the energy performance of urban residential buildings, using both ensemble-based machine learning and end-use demand segregation methods. The proposed methodology consists of five steps: data collection, archetype development, physics-based parametric modeling, machine learning modeling, and urban building energy performance analysis. The devised methodology is tested on the Irish residential building stock and generates a synthetic building dataset of one million buildings through the parametric modeling of 19 identified vital variables for four residential building archetypes. As a part of the machine learning modeling process, the study implemented an end-use demand segregation method, including heating, lighting, equipment, photovoltaic, and hot water, to predict the energy performance of buildings at an urban scale. Furthermore, the model's performance is enhanced by employing an ensemble-based machine learning approach, achieving 91\% accuracy compared to the traditional approach's 76\%. Accurate prediction of building energy performance enables stakeholders, including energy policymakers and urban planners, to make informed decisions when planning large-scale retrofit measures.},

Such RBs are defined with single envelope and equipment parameter values, for which calibration with actual building stock energy performance (EP) is not undertaken. Thus, it is not possible to visualise the effect of uncertainties or diversity in the input parameters on cost-optimal level benchmarks and to verify the choice of RBs. The paper proposes an update to the COM via use of “Probabilistic Bayesian calibrated RBs” to handle uncertainties and produce more realistic cost optimal levels to support policy makers in devising effective fiscal and legal support mechanisms while facilitating harmonised EP benchmarking between MS for different building categories. The process is validated by findings from Urban Building Energy Modelling studies showing that Energy Use Intensity (EUI) distributions from “probabilistic Bayesian calibrated RBs” versus “deterministic RBs” match significantly closer to the measured EUI distributions with a resulting reduction in the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test results of up to 82\% when monthly calibration was performed.},

To evaluate its effects, data on the site energy use intensity (EUI) of 2,660,159 certified and non-certified apartment units were collected from the Korea National Building Energy Database and compared. The site EUIs for total energy use of the certified apartment units with BEEC levels 1+ and 1 were 1.4–20.2\% lower than those of the non-certified apartment units. Particularly, the gas use (for heating) intensity was 3.5–26.4\% lower compared to that of the non-certified apartment. However, the electricity use intensity has not decreased despite BEEC because it does not consider the electricity consumption by appliances. In addition, the EUI of the certified apartment units with BEEC level 2 was higher than that of the non-certified apartment units in Group B. These show that the BEEC level 1 or higher contributed to reducing heating energy although its effect was different by climatic regions and the size of apartment units, but its effect on the electricity use intensity was insignificant. It shows that BEEC needs to be improved and some policies are needed to make residential building occupants more aware of the need for them to reduce their electricity consumption and to encourage them to do so.},

The proposed model urges the use of similar meteorological conditions in the building classification. We studied load profiles as energy footprint of six major load categories, and in accordance with some embodiments of peripheral parameters of ambient temperature, workday, time of day, daylight length, intensity of sunlight, number of occupants, and humidity. Among those major load categories, initially we disintegrated thermal loads through finding an equilibrium temperature from fitted cooling and heating functions. The contradiction of data and building occupancy renders disaggregation problem particularly challenging, so abiding to the definition of time equivalent occupancy (TEO), we deployed a k-means approach to categorize the daily load profile, where particular disaggregation approaches was selected for each individual load profile cluster to calculate the common and occupancy load categories. By imposing the daylight difference for equinox and solstice periods for non-working days, we estimated and extracted the exterior lighting. The remained accumulated energy casts alluded interior lighting with part of common and occupancy load categories, so a day light factor is proposed to offset the interior lighting from common and occupancy loads. We delineated an implementation of this framework using two case studies. The efficiency of our approach is demonstrated using a real data, where maximum EUI discrepancy errors of 4.84\% in lighting, 3.85\% for thermal, 1.6\% in common and 3.24\% in occupancy load categories were found between the proposed method and the sub-metered data.},

Accordingly, the benchmark EUI values, building data, and population data were used as input parameters to derive a convenient equation for predicting energy consumption in each grid of the urban energy use maps. A comparison of the measured and predicted energy consumptions confirmed the precision of this equation. To sum up, relevant data are readily available and can be exploited to prepare urban energy use maps for other large cities in Taiwan. Moreover, the urban energy use map with high spatial resolution can present the differences in small areas, making it an important reference aid for determining energy policies},

This study aimed to develop a prediction model for the cost saving potentials in implementing the BEER-certification, in which the cost saving potentials included the energy cost savings of the BEER-certification and the relevant CO2 emissions reduction as well as the additional construction cost for the BEER-certification. The prediction model was developed by using data mining, life cycle cost analysis, real option valuation, and Monte Carlo simulation. The database were established with 437 multi-family housing complexes (MFHCs), including 116 BEER-certified MFHCs and 321 non-certified MFHCs. The case study was conducted to validate the developed prediction model using 321 non-certified MFHCs, which considered 20-year life cycle. As a result, compared to the additional construction cost, the average cost saving potentials of the 1st-BEER-certified MFHCs in Groups 1, 2, and 3 were predicted to be 3.77\%, 2.78\%, and 2.87\%, respectively. The cost saving potentials can be used as a guideline for the additional construction cost of the BEER-certification in the early design phase.},

	abstract = {For almost two decades, the Zero Energy Buildings (ZEB) standard has epitomized a commitment to the high energy performance of buildings. Nevertheless, the applicability of ZEB in hot climates is currently limited and furthermore, in light of the current limitations of traditional building energy modeling methods, new methods are necessary to effectively evaluate the energy balance potential of larger districts. To help bridge this gap, this paper introduces solar-based (both sun-hours and solar irradiation) and geometry-based prediction metrics to be used in optimization studies to evaluate the impact of urban morphology on the energy balance of residential blocks in hot urban contexts. These prediction metrics are derived from the simulated energy performance of 1,944 parametric variations of residential blocks in Tel Aviv. In a regression analysis, these metrics recorded high correlation with energy demand, energy supply and the balance between them. To test the applicability of these metrics for optimization, the RBFMOpt method is employed in a multi-objective optimization study of the energy supply and demand of a nine-block residential district in Tel Aviv. Detailed energy simulations are performed for the best non-dominated results from the solar and geometric optimization studies and compared to the non-dominated results from a full energy optimization run. The results indicate that these metrics - the solar and geometric area-weighted exposure and shading indices - can serve as effective energy performance indicators to inform early-stage morphological decisions making. This workflow promotes urban energy optimization towards more harmonized energy supply and demand driven approaches.},

A robust and reliable tool that can estimate the Energy Use Intensity (EUI) of a city is required. This paper presents a new bottom-up engineering-based multi-layer approach able to analyse the energy performance of existing settlements of every size by retaining as much information as possible about their complexities. The process involves i) creating a 3D model of the urban area, ii) building up templates representing different building characteristics such as functions, the age-band of the buildings and operating schedules, iii) running dynamic thermal simulations and iv) displaying the EUI or total energy demand in the 3D model which can be post-processed for further analysis. This approach offers a flexible simulation process according to various purposes, which is particularly useful in decision-making for urban energy retrofitting or planning for new areas.

Bottom-up building stock energy modeling (BSEM) methods can contribute to this issue but have not been applied because of the need to represent short-term building stock dynamics in building systems and energy conservation measures (ECMs). To fill this gap, this study developed a BSEM framework that integrates top-down building stock decomposition, including building systems and ECMs, and bottom-up physics-based energy demand quantification using reference building models representing building stock segments. The framework was verified through a case study of a Japanese commercial building stock. The results indicate that the developed model effectively captures the short-term dynamics and contributions of the technologies. Although there are significant errors in estimating some building subsectors and end uses, the model predicts the changes in the aggregated energy consumption with acceptable accuracy. The Japanese 2030 emission reduction target cannot be achieved with the current technology deployment trends; however, the shortfall can be addressed by applying additional measures. Owing to its applicability to diverse building stocks, the framework promotes the use of BSEM for policy assessment and evidence-based policymaking for climate change mitigation.},

Accurate metrics regarding buildings' energy efficiency, including the energy class reported in Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs), are essential for such evaluations. In this study, we developed a machine learning-based model to predict the energy class of Italian buildings using publicly accessible data. The model, trained on a geographic subset of the Italian territory, achieves a 37\% accuracy rate, which increases to 74\% when allowing for a one-class margin of error (1-class accuracy). Further testing against a mortgage portfolio provided by a commercial bank yielded a 69\% 1-class accuracy. Comparison with statistics reported by the official EPC register (SIAPE) suggests a potential discrepancy in the representation of the worst energy efficiency class.},

	abstract = {Achieving the European Union's ambitious goal of transforming buildings into carbon-neutral assets is crucial for combating climate change and improving energy efficiency. The harmonization of Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) plays a vital role in this effort. It can provide a standardized measure of building energy performance, which is crucial for benchmarking and improving energy efficiency across Member States. In the context of the recast Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) of 2024, this study examines the progress made by EU Member States in standardizing EPCs. The research aims to evaluate the implementation of EPC indicators, focusing on data quality, calculation methods, and costs. The methodological procedure followed for the study led to the development of a dedicated Cross Comparative Matrix (CCM) to assess the implementation of EPC indicators across 27 EU Member States and their reading feature allowed the declination into three scenarios for different EPC data analysis: qualitative, quantitative and burden costs. The findings reveal significant disparities, particularly in areas such as thermal comfort and smart readiness, due to the lack of a common methodology and local regulatory differences. While key indicators like energy performance class and primary energy use are widely implemented, compliance with EU standards varies. The study concludes by recommending standardized methodologies and enhanced assessor training to improve EPC quality, harmonization, and effectiveness. This research contributes to policy discussions by offering a comprehensive framework for EPC evaluation and insights into improving data quality, reliability, and accessibility. The originality of this study lies in its cross-national analysis, highlighting the need for a unified EPC scheme to promote building sustainability across the EU.},

One of the policies implemented in recent years was the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) policy, which proposes building stock benchmarking to identify buildings that require rehabilitation. However, research shows that these mechanisms fail to engage stakeholders in the retrofit process because it is widely seen as a mandatory and complex bureaucracy. This study makes use of an EPC database to integrate machine learning techniques with multi-objective optimization and develop an interface capable of (1) predicting a building’s, or household’s, energy needs; and (2) providing the user with optimum retrofit solutions, costs, and return on investment. The goal is to provide an open-source, easy-to-use interface that guides the user in the building retrofit process. The energy and EPC prediction models show a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.84 and 0.79, and the optimization results for one case study EPC with a 2000€ budget limit in Évora, Portugal, show decreases of up to 60\% in energy needs and return on investments of up to 7 in 3 years.},

To face this issue several actions were taken in the European Union (EU), among these, the implementation of Energy Performance Certificates (EPC), which include a Recommendation List of Measures (RLMs) to retrofit buildings. Some concerns exist about the lack of confidence on these recommendations. The main objective of this study is to analyze the usefulness of the EPC, answering if it is possible to deliver a realistic financial assessment about renovation strategies using these tools. The study is based on three indicators: Consumption, energy saving variations and profitability. The study is based on a renovation project case study, where simulations and Life Cycle Cost Assessment (LCCA) were performed, in order to identify the different results that EPC’s and an energy efficiency assessment could lead to. The results show important differences in all the concepts evaluated.},

This paper presents several detailed energy performance evaluations on the Italian buildings based on a sample of over 2,000,000 EPCs extracted from the national EPC register (SIAPE), contributing to the definition of an updated energy performance baseline of the Italian building stock. This is the first work using the Italian EPC register to define such a baseline to the extent of the authors’ knowledge. Furthermore, combined analyses of EPC data were carried out to obtain information on the influence of the Italian energy regulations on building characteristics and on the effectiveness of energy strategy application for building renovation. This study underlines the relevance of EPC registers and how the combined analysis of EPC parameters can provide a large amount of useful information on several aspects of the building stock, allowing the monitoring of the impact of the Italian energy policy framework on buildings energy performance.

	abstract = {Thermography is becoming more widely used amongst construction professionals for energy related defect detection in buildings. Until quite recently, most of the research and practical use of building thermography has centred on employing a building walk-around or walk-through methodology to detect sources of unacceptable energy use. However, thermographers are now creating new building thermography methodologies that seek to address some of the known limitations, such as camera spatial resolution, transient climatic conditions and differences in material properties. Often such limitations are misunderstood and sometimes ignored. This study presents a review of the existing literature, covering both well-established and emerging building thermography methodologies. By critically appraising techniques and observing methodology applications for specific energy related defects, a much clearer picture has been formed that will help thermographic researchers and thermographers to decide upon the best methodology for performing building thermography investigations and for the invention of new approaches. Whilst this paper shows that many of the different passive building thermography methodologies seek to address particular building issues such as defects and energy use, it has also demonstrated a lack of correlation between the different methodology types, where one methodology is often chosen over another for a particular reason, rather than making use of several methodologies to better understand building performance. Therefore this paper has identified the potential for using several passive building thermography methodologies together in a phased approach to building surveying using thermography. For example, a less costly and faster survey could be conducted to quickly identify certain defects before enabling more time consuming and expensive surveys to hone in on these with greater detail and spatial resolution if deemed necessary.},

	abstract = {Thermal radiation generated by limited resources is emitted from the surfaces and interpreted as temperature. On the other hand, the limited resources necessitate prevention of energy leakages causing noticeable temperature differences on surfaces. Providing sensitive information on temperature contrast, infrared thermography (IRT) is a prominent tool for detecting infrared energy on the surfaces of the objects. IRT is also very promising method for detecting thermal irregularities, air leakages and even moisture abnormalities on building envelopes. Since the concept of nearly zero energy buildings is to be the main target of energy policies in European Union published by European Commission, improving thermal performance of buildings becomes crucial in the last decade. Therefore, implementation of IRT for visualizing and analyzing concealed defects on building envelopes is very promising for improving the energy efficiency of buildings. Given recent regulations and benefits of emerging thermogram technologies mentioned above, a detailed review of the previous studies investigating the abnormalities of building envelopes by IRT is presented in this paper. Furthermore, the applications with measurement methods, analysis schemes and analysis types are classified to highlight the potential of IRT in inspection of building envelopes for providing energy efficient solutions. Finally, recent advances and practical future opportunities are presented for additional contribution of the IRT methods previously employed.},

Its popularity for a broad range of applications can be attributed to its non-contact safe nature, its usefulness and effectiveness, as well as the energy and cost savings it can achieve. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art literature and research regarding the passive and active infrared thermography. The fundamentals of IRT are thoroughly explained and the thermographic process for building diagnostics is presented. This work also presents the fields of applicability of IRT with a focus on the building sector, as well as the advantages, limitations and potential sources of errors of IRT employment. Additionally previous non-destructive testing (NDT) studies that employed passive, active pulsed, and active lock-in thermographies for building diagnostics are presented. A review of the thermal image analysis methods and the future trends of thermal imaging are also included in this work. It can be concluded that while IRT is a useful tool for the characterisation of defects in the building sector, there is great prospect for the development of more advanced, effective and accurate approaches that will employ a combination of thermography approaches.},

The passive approach is the most common to detect thermally significant defects. Thus, a specific procedure for the energy audit has been reported, matching different standards, guidelines, and professional advice. Similarly, recurring energy related problems are toughly presented (i.e. thermal characterization of buildings; thermal bridging, insulation level, air leakage and moisture detection; indoor temperature and U-value measurements; human comfort assessment). Finally, advantages and potential sources of errors as well as future trends in the use of IRT for the energy audit have been described.

	abstract = {Energy consumption of buildings could be significantly reduced by improving the efficiency of the envelope. Currently, the estimation of the energy performance of existing buildings requires the knowledge of the overall heat transfer coefficient (U-value) of the walls. U-values can be calculated through a theoretical approach, knowing the thermal conductivity and thickness of each material that constitutes the wall stratigraphy, from project data or coring. Alternatively, U-values can be obtained experimentally, through the ISO recommended heat flow meter measurements. Although generally accepted, the heat flow meter method suffers from some disadvantages. Recently, an alternative approach based on infrared thermography (IRT) has been proposed for in situ measurements. Main advantages of this new approach are non invasivity and the possibility of inspecting relatively large areas in real time. In this paper, after a brief description of the state of the art in the field of U-value measurement by IRT, a case study is described. In particular, the results obtained by IRT on an existing building are compared with U-values given by the standard ISO calculation and heat flow meter measurements; advantages and limitations of the new method are outlined. Some suggestions for a successful exploiting of the IRT approach are also given.},

A key objective is the retrofitting of the existing building envelope. A necessary first step in the building envelope optimization process is the assessment of its actual thermal performance. This assessment should be repeated after retrofitting to clearly define the improvements that were made and the heat loss reduction that was achieved. In this study, an efficient, non-destructive, in-situ measurement method, based on an outdoor infrared thermographic survey, is developed to determine the thermal bridging performance. As wind velocity significantly influences the heat losses through the building envelope, this study includes quantification of the wind velocity impact on the Ψ-value. This was assessed by undertaking ITT of the same thermal bridge at various wind velocities, in a controlled environment, in a hot box device. The results showed that the Ψ-value is highly dependent on wind velocity so that measurement of the Ψ-value taken at different wind conditions cannot be directly compared. An adjustment procedure is proposed that can be used to convert the Ψ-value measured at any wind velocity to a standard value corresponding to a velocity of 4m/s. From a practical point of view, this adjustment procedure makes the methodology widely applicable.},

	abstract = {Buildings are responsible for 40\% of global energy use and contribute towards 30\% of the total CO2 emissions. The drive to reduce energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions from buildings has acted as a catalyst in the increasing installation of meters and sensors for monitoring energy use and indoor environmental conditions in buildings. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in building energy metering and environmental monitoring, including their social, economic, environmental and legislative drivers. The integration of meters and sensors with existing building energy management systems (BEMS) is critically appraised, especially with regard to communication technologies and protocols such as ModBus, M-Bus, Ethernet, Cellular, ZigBee, WiFi and BACnet. Findings suggest that energy metering is covered in existing policies and regulations in only a handful of countries. Most of the legislations and policies on energy metering in Europe are in response to the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), 2002/91/EC. However, recent developments in policy are pointing towards more stringent metering requirements in future, moving away from voluntary to mandatory compliance. With regards to metering equipment, significant developments have been made in the recent past on miniaturisation, accuracy, robustness, data storage, ability to connect using multiple communication protocols, and the integration with BEMS and the Cloud – resulting in a range of available solutions, selection of which can be challenging. Developments in communication technologies, in particular in low-power wireless such as ZigBee and Bluetooth LE (BLE), are enabling cost-effective machine to machine (M2M) and internet of things (IoT) implementation of sensor networks. Privacy and data protection, however, remain a concern for data aggregators and end-users. The standardization of network protocols and device functionalities remains an active area of research and development, especially due to the prevalence of many protocols in the BEMS industry. Available solutions often lack interoperability between hardware and software systems, resulting in vendor lock-in. The paper provides a comprehensive understanding of available technologies for energy metering and environmental monitoring; their drivers, advantages and limitations; factors affecting their selection and future directions of research and development – for use a reference, as well as for generating further interest in this expanding research area.},

However, for existing buildings with historically recorded time series energy data, statistical and machine learning techniques have proved to be more accurate and quick. This study presents a comprehensive review of the existing machine learning techniques for forecasting time series energy consumption. Although the emphasis is given to a single time series data analysis, the review is not just limited to it since energy data is often co-analyzed with other time series variables like outdoor weather and indoor environmental conditions. The nine most popular forecasting techniques that are based on the machine learning platform are analyzed. An in-depth review and analysis of the ‘hybrid model’, that combines two or more forecasting techniques is also presented. The various combinations of the hybrid model are found to be the most effective in time series energy forecasting for building.},

	abstract = {Short-term building cooling load prediction is the essential foundation for many building energy management tasks, such as fault detection and diagnosis, demand-side management and control optimization. Conventional methods, which heavily rely on physical principles, have limited power in practice as their performance is subject to many physical assumptions. By contrast, data-driven methods have gained huge interests due to their flexibility in model development and the rich data available in modern buildings. The rapid development in data science has provided advanced data analytics to tackle prediction problems in a more convenient, efficient and effective way. This paper investigates the potential of one of the most promising techniques in advanced data analytics, i.e., deep learning, in predicting 24-h ahead building cooling load profiles. Deep learning refers to a collection of machine learning algorithms which are powerful in revealing nonlinear and complex patterns in big data. Deep learning can be used either in a supervised manner to develop prediction models with given inputs and output (i.e., cooling load), or in an unsupervised manner to extract meaningful features from raw data as model inputs. This study exploits the potential of deep learning in both manners, and compares its performance in cooling load prediction with typical feature extraction methods and popular prediction techniques in the building field. The results show that deep learning can enhance the performance of building cooling load prediction, especially when used in an unsupervised manner for constructing high-level features as model inputs. Using the features extracted by unsupervised deep learning as inputs for cooling load prediction can evidently enhance the prediction performance. The findings are enlightening and could bring more flexible and effective solutions for building energy predictions.},

	abstract = {In the European Union, the building sector is one of the largest energy consumer with about 40\% of the final energy consumption. Reducing consumption is also a sociological, technological and scientific matter. New methods have to be devised in order to support building professionals in their effort to optimize designs and to enhance energy performances. Indeed, the research field related to building modelling and energy performances prediction is very productive, involving various scientific domains. Among them, one can distinguish physics-related fields, focusing on the resolution of equations simulating building thermal behaviour and mathematics-related ones, consisting in the implementation of prediction model thanks to machine learning techniques. This paper proposes a detailed review and discussion of these works. First, the approaches based on physical (“white box”) models are reviewed according three-category classification. Then, we present the main machine learning (“black box”) tools used for prediction of energy consumption, heating/cooling demand, indoor temperature. Eventually, a third approach called hybrid (“grey box”) method is introduced, which uses both physical and statistical techniques. The paper covers a wide range of research works, giving the base principles of each technique and numerous illustrative examples.},

	abstract = {Buildings are the dominant source of energy consumption and environmental emissions in urban areas. Therefore, the ability to forecast and characterize building energy consumption is vital to implementing urban energy management and efficiency initiatives required to curb emissions. Advances in smart metering technology have enabled researchers to develop “sensor based” approaches to forecast building energy consumption that necessitate less input data than traditional methods. Sensor-based forecasting utilizes machine learning techniques to infer the complex relationships between consumption and influencing variables (e.g., weather, time of day, previous consumption). While sensor-based forecasting has been studied extensively for commercial buildings, there is a paucity of research applying this data-driven approach to the multi-family residential sector. In this paper, we build a sensor-based forecasting model using Support Vector Regression (SVR), a commonly used machine learning technique, and apply it to an empirical data-set from a multi-family residential building in New York City. We expand our study to examine the impact of temporal (i.e., daily, hourly, 10min intervals) and spatial (i.e., whole building, by floor, by unit) granularity have on the predictive power of our single-step model. Results indicate that sensor based forecasting models can be extended to multi-family residential buildings and that the optimal monitoring granularity occurs at the by floor level in hourly intervals. In addition to implications for the development of residential energy forecasting models, our results have practical significance for the deployment and installation of advanced smart metering devices. Ultimately, accurate and cost effective wide-scale energy prediction is a vital step towards next-generation energy efficiency initiatives, which will require not only consideration of the methods, but the scales for which data can be distilled into meaningful information.},

The principal component analysis (PCA) is used to select the significant modeling inputs and simplify the model structure. The investigation utilizes two different historical data sets in hourly interval, which are collected from the Energy Prediction Shootout contest I and a campus building located in East China.

The comparison results reveal that both iPSO-ANN and GA-ANN models have better accuracy than that of ANN ones. From the perspective of time consuming, the iPSO-ANN model has shorter modeling time than GA-ANN method.

Therefore, improvement of energy efficiency of the building sector has become an essential target to reduce the amount of gas emission as well as fossil fuel consumption. One most effective approach to reducing CO2 emission and energy consumption with regards to new buildings is to consider energy efficiency at a very early design stage. On the other hand,efficient energy management and smart refurbishments can enhance energy performance of the existing stock. All these solutions entail accurate energy prediction for optimal decision making. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) in general and machine learning (ML) techniques in specific terms have been proposed for forecasting of building energy consumption and performance.

The increasing presence of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in commercial buildings has resulted in a rising availability of high frequency interval data. These data can be used for a variety of energy efficiency applications such as demand response, fault detection and diagnosis, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) optimization. This large amount of data has also opened the door to the use of advanced statistical learning models, which hold promise for providing accurate building baseline energy consumption predictions, and thus accurate saving estimations. The gradient boosting machine is a powerful machine learning algorithm that is gaining considerable traction in a wide range of data driven applications, such as ecology, computer vision, and biology. In the present work an energy consumption baseline modeling method based on a gradient boosting machine was proposed. To assess the performance of this method, a recently published testing procedure was used on a large dataset of 410 commercial buildings. The model training periods were varied and several prediction accuracy metrics were used to evaluate the model’s performance. The results show that using the gradient boosting machine model improved the R‐squared prediction accuracy and the CV(RMSE) in more than 80 percent of the cases, when compared to an industry best practice model that is based on piecewise linear regression, and to a random forest algorithm.},

	abstract = {Broadly speaking, building energy use prediction can be classified into two categories based on modeling approaches namely engineering and Artificial Intelligence (AI). While engineering approach requires solving physical equations representing the thermal performance of systems and components that constitute the buildings, the AI-based approach uses historical data to predict future performance. Although engineering approach estimates energy use with greater accuracy, it falls short in the overall complexity of model building and simulation in which detailed data that represent the building geometry, systems, configurations, and occupant schedule is needed. Whereas, the AI-based approach offers a rapid prediction of building energy use and, if appropriately trained and tested, may be used for quick and efficient decision-making of energy use reduction. Nevertheless, for robust integration with and to improve automated building systems management and intelligence, the need for consistent, stable, and higher prediction accuracy cannot be understated. To alleviate the instability issue, and to improve prediction accuracy, we have exploited and tested an ensemble learning technique, ‘Ensemble Bagging Trees’ (EBT), using data obtained from meteorological systems and building-level occupancy and meters.Results showed that the proposed EBT model predicted hourly electricity demand of the test building with improved accuracy of Mean Absolute Prediction Error that ranged from 2.97\% to 4.63\%. Additionally, results showed that proposed variable selection method could reduce the computation time of EBT by 38–41\% without sacrificing the prediction accuracy. The proposed ensemble learning model that exemplifies improved prediction accuracy over other AI techniques can be used for real-time applications such as system fault detection and diagnosis.},

Given that buildingrelated activities contribute to almost a quarter of EU greenhouse gas emissions, the implementation of new regulations to decarbonize this sector is paramount. However, policymakers must carefully evaluate policies to mitigate transition risks associated with these regulations, as buildings represent a significant portion of household wealth and bank assets. Accurate metrics regarding buildings' energy efficiency, including the energy class reported in Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs), are essential for such evaluations. In this study, we developed a machine learning-based model to predict the energy class of Italian buildings using publicly accessible data. The model, trained on a geographic subset of the Italian territory, achieves a 37\% accuracy rate, which increases to 74\% when allowing for a one-class margin of error (1-class accuracy). Further testing against a mortgage portfolio provided by a commercial bank yielded a 69\% 1-class accuracy. Comparison with statistics reported by the official EPC register (SIAPE) suggests a potential discrepancy in the representation of the worst energy efficiency class.},

However, with less than one percent of its housing stock being replaced annually, retrofitting existing homes has significant importance in meeting energy-efficiency targets. Consequently, many physics-based and data-driven models and tools have been developed to analyse the effects of retrofit strategies from various points of view. This paper aims to develop a data-driven AI model that predicts buildings’ energy performance based on their features under various retrofit scenarios. In this context, four different machine learning models were developed based on the EPC (Energy Performance Certificate) dataset for residential buildings and standard assessment procedure (SAP) guidelines in the UK. Additionally, an interface was designed that enables users to analyse the effect of different retrofit strategies on a building’s energy performance using the developed AI models. The results of this study revealed the artificial neural network as the most accurate predictive model, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.82 and a mean percentage error of 11.9 percent. However, some conceptual irregularities were observed across all the models when dealing with different retrofit scenarios. All summary, such tools can be further improved to offer a potential alternative or support to physics-based models, enhancing the efficiency of retrofitting processes in buildings.},

EPCs and metered energy use were converted to primary energy use intensity (PEUI) to provide a comparison of the same quantity for the first time. We show that EPCs predict significantly more energy use than metered in homes in Great Britain. EPC bands A and B show no statistically significant difference, but all other bands show a significant gap which increases as EPC rating worsens. The PEUI gap widens from −26 kWh/yr/m2 (−8\%) for band C to −276 kWh/y/m2 (−48\%) for bands F and G. Unlike previous research, we show that the difference persists in homes matching the EPC-model assumptions regarding occupancy, thermostat set-point and whole-home heating; suggesting that occupant behaviour is unlikely to fully explain the discrepancy. EPCs are a core tool in the residential energy sector, and the gap between EPC-modelled and metered energy use could have a significant impact on policy, research, and industry. Future research should investigate disaggregated components of energy use, the underlying thermal model, and assumptions regarding building characteristics.},

	abstract = {Advanced energy benchmarking in residential buildings, using data-driven modeling, provides a fast, accurate, and systematic approach to assessing energy performance and comparing it with reference standards or targets. This process is essential for identifying opportunities to improve energy efficiency and for shaping effective energy retrofit strategies. However, building professionals often face barriers to adopting these tools, mainly due to the complexity and limited interpretability of data-driven models, which can negatively affect decision-making. In order to contribute in addressing these issues, this study combines data-driven modeling with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to advance energy benchmarking analysis in residential buildings and enhance their usability by also non-expert users. The proposed process focuses on estimating primary energy demand for space heating and domestic hot water in residential building units, extracting knowledge from about 49,000 Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) issued in the Piedmont Region, Italy. The effectiveness of five machine learning algorithms is assessed to select the most suitable estimation model. Then to ensure the trustworthiness of the selected model, a XAI layer is implemented to identify and remove input variable domain regions that demonstrated to be critical for the robustness of the inference mechanism learnt in the training phase. Moreover, the study assesses the model capability to evaluate building energy performance, examining both the current state and potential scenarios for energy retrofitting. A second XAI layer is then introduced to provide local explanations for model estimations of both pre- and post-retrofit conditions of a building. The final aim is to enable an external benchmarking analysis, by extracting from the analysed EPCs reference groups of similar buildings, that facilitate a performance comparison for the investigated retrofit scenarios. This energy benchmarking process promotes transparent and informed decision-making, aiming to instill confidence in final users when leveraging data-driven models for energy planning in the building sector.},

	abstract = {Building energy modeling plays an important role in analyzing the energy efficiency of the existing building stock, helping in enhancing it by testing possible retrofit scenarios. This work presents an urban scale and place-based approach that utilizes energy performance certificates to develop a statistical energy model. The objective is to describe the energy modeling methodology for evaluating the energy performance of residential buildings in Milan; in addition, a comprehensive reference dataset for input data from available open databases in Italy is provided—a critical step in assessing energy consumption and production at territorial scale. The study employs open-source software QGIS 3.28.8 to model and calculate various energy-related variables for the prediction of space heating, domestic hot water consumptions, and potential solar production. By analyzing demand/supply profiles, the research aims to increase energy self-consumption and self-sufficiency in the urban context using solar technologies. The presented methodology is validated by comparing simulation results with measured data, achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 5.2\%, which is acceptable, especially considering city-scale modeling. The analysis sheds light on key parameters affecting building energy consumption/production, such as type of user, volume, surface-to-volume ratio, construction period, systems’ efficiency, solar exposition and roof area. Additionally, this assessment attempts to evaluate the spatial distribution of energy-use and production within urban environments, contributing to the planning and realization of smart cities.},
