\section{Introduction}
Balancing occupant thermal comfort and energy efficiency in buildings remains a central challenge in building operation, as HVAC systems account for a significant portion of total building energy use and are responsible for over 40\% of energy consumption in commercial buildings \cite{Crawley2001}.  Traditional HVAC control strategies rely on fixed set‐point schedules or the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) analytical model, which uses heat‐balance equations standardized in ISO 7730 to estimate thermal sensation \cite{Fanger1970}.  However, PMV cannot dynamically adapt to real occupant feedback, clothing changes, or activity levels, often leading to suboptimal comfort and increased energy use \cite{Schaudienst2017}.  

Recent developments leverage large‐scale field data to create data‐driven and adaptive comfort models rooted in actual occupant votes.  The ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II, comprising over 76 000 human subject records from 30 countries, has enabled novel predictive comfort models that outperform PMV in real‐world scenarios \cite{Foldvary2018}.  Adaptive standards such as ASHRAE 55 and EN 15251 further incorporate environmental and personal factors, yet still lack integration with building energy simulations \cite{deDear2018}.  

Concurrently, machine learning techniques have proven effective for both energy consumption prediction and thermal sensation estimation.  Gradient Boosting methods like LightGBM offer fast, accurate energy‐use forecasts suitable for real‐time control \cite{Ke2017}, while recent physics‐informed neural network–variational autoencoder (PINN‐VAE) architectures leverage physical laws and latent representations to predict thermal sensation with high fidelity \cite{Chen2023}.  Interpretable ML frameworks have been reviewed in several studies, highlighting their potential to enhance both comfort and efficiency in building operations \cite{turn1search6}.  Simulation platforms such as Sinergym enable stochastic weather perturbations and RL‐based control development by interfacing Python agents with EnergyPlus \cite{JimenezRaboso2021}.  

Despite these advances, existing co‐simulation frameworks (e.g., Python EMS \cite{turn1search8}, FMU‐based coupling \cite{turn1search9}) rarely integrate ML‐predicted comfort metrics directly into EnergyPlus control loops.  As a result, there remains a gap in leveraging occupant‐centric ML models for set‐point optimization within building energy simulations.  

To address this gap, we propose:  
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A co‐simulation framework combining PINN‐VAE (thermal sensation) and LightGBM (energy use) models grounded in ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II.  
  \item An ML‐like grid‐search control algorithm that minimally adjusts HVAC set‐points based on predicted TSVs, applied to both PMV‐ and ML‐based predictors.  
  \item A key finding that PMV‐based controllers, when optimized via grid‐search, achieve energy savings comparable to optimized ML‐based controllers, whereas grid‐search yields marginal gains on already optimized ML predictors.  
  \item Validation of our approach across four DOE climate zones with stochastic weather perturbations to ensure robustness of energy and comfort performance.  
\end{enumerate}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.  Section \ref{sec:related_work} reviews relevant literature; Section \ref{sec:methodology} details our co‐simulation and control algorithms; Section \ref{sec:experimental_design} describes the experimental setup; Section \ref{sec:results} presents and discusses the findings; and Section \ref{sec:conclusions} concludes with implications and future work.
