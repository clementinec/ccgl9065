%% Abstract - Revise. mention nature of aging, clarify relationship between wet markets and MSBs. 


Municipal Service Buildings (MSBs) in Hong Kong combine unique architectural heritage with essential civic functions, particularly through their semi-open wet markets known as Cooked Food Centers (CFCs). Recent retrofits have transformed these traditionally naturally ventilated spaces into fully sealed, actively cooled environments, raising concerns about unintended consequences. This study employs snapshot measurements of indoor environmental quality (iEQ), focusing on carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) concentrations, air temperature, relative humidity, particulate matter (PM2.5), and air velocity, to diagnose the ventilation efficiency, thermal comfort, and energy implications of these retrofit strategies. By comparing actively cooled retrofitted buildings against mixed-mode ventilated counterparts during summer conditions, we reveal that retrofitted markets exhibit elevated $CO_2$ concentrations approximately 216 ppm higher on average, along with reduced thermal comfort and increased cooling loads (estimated at 128–255 kW additional demand for a typical market). Our diagnostic approach highlights critical trade-offs inherent in active cooling retrofits and underscores the importance of context-sensitive, hybrid ventilation solutions that better balance occupant comfort, indoor air quality, and energy efficiency.

\section{Introduction}
Hong Kong’s municipal service buildings (MSBs) represent a unique part of the city’s architectural heritage. The MSBs were not just utilitarian structures but became essential communal hubs, serving as “urban living rooms” where social interactions flourished, particularly in dense neighborhoods lacking shared public spaces. Unlike traditional markets in other cities, Hong Kong’s MSBs were uniquely designed to accommodate a variety of public functions, reinforcing their role as key civic anchors. These high-rise structures combine mixed-use spaces and communal areas, with the lower floors dedicated to wet markets—locally known as cooked food centers (CFCs). Traditionally, these CFCs have been semi‑open and naturally ventilated. Built in the 1970s and 1980s across 41 locations\cite{2}, they now serve a population of 7.4 million and are approaching the time for retrofit.

Recent pilot retrofit projects are converting these semi-open CFCs into fully sealed, actively cooled, supermarket-like spaces. Such retrofits may come with unintended consequences. Sealing the building envelope can degrade ventilation performance—evidenced by higher $CO_2$ level, diminish thermal comfort, and increase energy consumption. These unintended costs of modernization raise a critical question: Is enclosing MSBs and CFCs and relying solely on active cooling the most appropriate retrofit strategy? Although many studies have focused on improving indoor environmental quality (iEQ) for occupant comfort, few have used iEQ measurements as a diagnostic tool to assess the design trade-offs in current retrofit strategies. Several previous works have employed $CO_2$ as a proxy for ventilation efficiency\cite{23,24,25}; however, there remains a gap in evaluating how different retrofit designs impact ventilation, thermal comfort, and energy consumption. 

In this study, our main objective is to evaluate the impact of retrofitting CFCs from semi-open, naturally ventilated spaces to fully enclosed, actively cooled environments, focusing on ventilation performance and energy use\cite{5,6}. We capture short bursts of iEQ data in CFCs to diagnose the performance of existing retrofit designs and incorporate a back-of-the-envelope calculation to estimate the extra energy demand resulting from increased cooling loads. It is important to emphasize that our approach is diagnostic rather than performing a traditional before-and-after comparison. Instead of assessing changes post-retrofit, this study uses snapshot measurements to evaluate trade-offs in current retrofit designs, providing insights to refine existing strategies.

%It is important to note that our approach is diagnostic, aiming to highlight the trade-offs of current retrofit designs rather than performing a traditional before-and-after comparison.

Our findings provide quantitative evidence that this retrofit strategy leads to higher $CO_2$ concentrations\cite{7}, poorer thermal comfort and greater energy consumption\cite{8,9}. For MSBs and CFCs, these costs underscore the need to prioritize renovation and refurbishment strategies over comprehensive retrofits. This study holds particular significance, as over 38 MSBs in Hong Kong—along with similar wet markets in Singapore and South Asia—may soon require retrofitting. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: a background section outlining the retrofit challenge and the use of $CO_2$ as a metric, a methodology section describing our measurement and analysis techniques, and a conclusion that discusses our findings and study limitations.


%^\section{Introduction}

    % The evolution of Municipal Service Buildings (MSBs) in Hong Kong reflects a complex interplay of cultural traditions, urban development, and technological advancements. Historically, wet markets in Hong Kong were open-air affairs, relying entirely on natural ventilation - a design well-suited to the humid subtropical climate. As Hong Kong rapidly urbanized in the post-war period, purpose-built market buildings emerged, often integrated into larger multi-use complexes\cite{1}. These early designs still favored natural ventilation, with high ceilings and open layouts. 
    % The MSBs were not just utilitarian structures but became essential communal hubs, serving as “urban living rooms” where social interactions flourished, particularly in dense neighborhoods lacking shared public spaces. Unlike traditional markets in other cities, Hong Kong’s MSBs were uniquely designed to accommodate a variety of public functions, reinforcing their role as key civic anchors. 
    % The 1980s saw the introduction of Cooked Food Centers (CFCs), often incorporated into the upper floors of wet market buildings, creating unique ventilation challenges\cite{2}. Over time, there has been a gradual shift towards mixed-mode ventilation, where natural ventilation is supplemented by mechanical systems\cite{3,4}. 
    % This shift, however, was not purely a technical adjustment—it also altered the spatial and social dynamics of MSBs. Market stalls that were once open and porous to the street began to close in, disrupting the informal but critical exchange between vendors and customers.
    % This historical trajectory has led to the current situation where we see a spectrum of ventilation strategies across Hong Kong's markets, from predominantly naturally ventilated spaces to those with significant mechanical intervention. The challenge now lies in finding optimal solutions for retrofitting these spaces that can maintain their cultural and functional essence while meeting modern standards for comfort and hygiene. 
    % As redevelopment pressures mount, there is a risk that MSBs—once vibrant, accessible, and inherently sustainable—will be replaced by more enclosed, privatized spaces that compromise their communal value. 
    % This presents complex challenges for engineers and architects in balancing tradition with modernity, energy efficiency with comfort, and regulatory compliance with the unique atmospheric qualities that make Hong Kong's markets such vibrant urban spaces.
    
    % Recognizing the natural tendency to switch to ventilation performances for the retrofits for the MSBs\cite{5,6}, we set out to explore the indoor environmental quality across several municipal services buildings in Hong Kong and assess their corresponding environmental parameters on what the hidden prices this switch might be bringing, in particular how does this unique challenge of conditioning wet markets better leads to in terms of thermal comfort\cite{7}, $CO_2$ levels\cite{8} and general air quality\cite{9}. 
    % Importantly, while $CO_2$ levels are typically discussed in the context of indoor air quality, in MSBs, they serve as a much broader indicator of the changing nature of public space. Rising $CO_2$ levels post-retrofit suggest not just a ventilation issue but a fundamental shift in how people move, gather, and interact in these spaces.
    % Our investigation span through various summer months in Hong Kong and three MSBs under comparable yet different outdoor condition as we aim to provide a fuller picture towards how the indoor environment varies, in particular towards different levels of gusts/winds\cite{10}. With our results, we were able to show that there is a characteristic difference between the pre and post retrofit MSBs in particular on its thermal comfort levels and the $CO_2$ levels, 
    % raising concerns about whether modernization efforts are, in fact, diminishing the core functions that made these spaces valuable to the communities they serve. By framing $CO_2$ levels not only as an air quality metric but as a measure of social density and urban vitality, this study highlights the unintended consequences of retrofits that prioritize enclosure and mechanical control over the adaptive, semi-open nature that originally defined MSBs.
    % This leads on to a possible indication that post-retrofit the comfort level might drop alongside the ventilation rate within.

    % The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened awareness of indoor air quality (IAQ) and its role in mitigating airborne disease transmission\cite{11,12}, particularly in dense urban environments like Hong Kong\cite{13,14}. This has led to increased pressure to enhance ventilation systems in public spaces [16]. Recognizing the tendency to switch to ventilation performances for MSB retrofits [5,6], our study explores the indoor environmental quality across several Hong Kong MSBs, assessing the implications of this switch on thermal comfort\cite{7}, $CO_2$ levels [8], and general air quality\cite{9}. By investigating these buildings under varying outdoor conditions\cite{10}, we aim to provide a comprehensive picture of how indoor environments change post-retrofit, particularly in terms of thermal comfort and ventilation rates.

    % While IAQ and thermal comfort have been widely studied, there is limited research on multi-functional, semi-open spaces like MSBs. Existing studies often overlook the architectural and functional challenges inherent to retrofitting these spaces, especially in densely populated urban areas. Our study addresses this gap by leveraging $CO_2$ as a proxy for ventilation performance\cite{20,21,peng2021exhaled}, a method particularly suited to these complex environments. This approach offers a practical way to assess air quality and ventilation performance in spaces where traditional methods may be less applicable.

    % More explicitly, Cooked Food Centers (CFCs) in Municipal Service Buildings (MSBs) of Hong Kong and very similarly wet market environments in Singapore present unique challenges for ventilation assessment and retrofit strategies. These semi-open, mixed-use spaces operate in hot, humid climates and experience highly variable occupancy and activity levels, creating complex air flow patterns influenced by both natural and mechanical ventilation. Traditional $CO_2$-based ventilation assessment methods, typically applied in enclosed, mechanically ventilated spaces, fall short in accurately capturing the dynamic nature of these environments. 
    
    % Our study proposes a novel application of $CO_2$ measurements to evaluate not just the spaces themselves, but also the effectiveness of various ventilation strategies and retrofit approaches. By comparing $CO_2$ levels, thermal comfort, and air quality parameters across different MSB designs and ventilation systems, we offer a unique perspective on the real-world performance of these strategies in complex, semi-open urban spaces. This approach extends beyond traditional applications of $CO_2$ monitoring, providing valuable insights into the trade-offs between natural ventilation, mechanical systems, and mixed-mode approaches in the context of modernizing culturally significant urban markets. Our method offers a practical tool for assessing and comparing retrofit strategies, bridging the gap between theoretical models and the actual performance of these vital public spaces in dense urban environments.

    % Our objectives for this study are therefore three-fold:
    % \begin{enumerate}
    %     \item Evaluate the effectiveness of different ventilation strategies in MSBs through comparative analysis of $CO_2$ levels, thermal comfort [7], and general air quality\cite{9};
    %     \item Assess the implications of retrofitting on indoor environmental quality, particularly in wet markets and CFCs;
    %     \item Identify practical retrofit strategies that balance IAQ improvements with energy efficiency and cultural preservation.
    % \end{enumerate}
    
    % We conducted measurements across several Hong Kong MSBs under varying outdoor conditions\cite{10}, providing a comprehensive picture of indoor environmental changes post-retrofit. This approach allows for a nuanced understanding of the trade-offs involved in modernizing these spaces.
    
    % We believe by addressing challenges specific to high-density, mixed-use buildings like CFCs, this research provides a framework for designing more adaptive and sustainable retrofit strategies. These insights are crucial in the context of global urbanization and the increasing demand for energy-efficient yet functional public spaces, contributing to broader urban resilience strategies\cite{bhagat2020effects}.
    

%\section{Background}
    % The evolution of market spaces and ventilation strategies in Hong Kong reflects a complex interplay of cultural traditions, urban development, and technological advancements. Historically, wet markets in Hong Kong, like many in Southeast Asia, were open-air affairs, relying entirely on natural ventilation. This design was well-suited to the humid subtropical climate, allowing for efficient air movement and heat dissipation.
    
    % As Hong Kong rapidly urbanized in the post-war period, there was a push to modernize and formalize these traditional markets. The 1960s and 1970s saw the emergence of purpose-built market buildings, often integrated into larger multi-use complexes. These early designs still heavily favored natural ventilation, with high ceilings, open layouts, and strategic positioning to maximize air flow.
    
    % The concept of Cooked Food Centers (CFCs) emerged in the 1970s as a way to regulate and improve hygiene standards for street food vendors. These were often incorporated into the upper floors of wet market buildings, creating a unique challenge for ventilation design. The need to manage cooking fumes and maintain comfort in these densely occupied spaces led to the introduction of mechanical ventilation systems, typically in the form of large exhaust fans.
    
    % The 1990s and 2000s saw increasing pressure to 'modernize' these spaces further, often driven by changing public expectations and stricter hygiene regulations. This period saw experiments with various hybrid ventilation strategies, attempting to balance the benefits of natural ventilation with the control offered by mechanical systems. As markets were integrated into larger, more complex buildings, floor plans indeed became deeper, making purely natural ventilation less effective. In response, some areas, particularly those further from the perimeter, began to incorporate active cooling.
    
    % However, it's important to note that this approach is not universal. Many CFCs and wet markets in Hong Kong still primarily rely on mixed-mode ventilation, where natural ventilation is supplemented by mechanical systems rather than replaced entirely. The extent of active cooling often depends on factors such as the building's age, location, and specific layout. This historical trajectory has led to the current situation where we see a spectrum of ventilation strategies across Hong Kong's markets, from predominantly naturally ventilated spaces to those with significant mechanical intervention. The challenge now lies in finding optimal solutions that can maintain the cultural and functional essence of these spaces while meeting modern standards for comfort and hygiene.
    
    % Our study, therefore, is situated at a critical juncture in this evolution. By comparing different ventilation strategies, we aim to inform future directions that can balance tradition with modernity, energy efficiency with comfort, and regulatory compliance with the unique atmospheric qualities that make Hong Kong's markets such vibrant urban spaces.

\section{Background}
\subsection{Evolution and Retrofit Challenge of Hong Kong’s MSBs and CFCs}    
    Hong Kong’s municipal service buildings (MSBs) embody a unique architectural heritage that reflects the city’s rapid post‐war urbanization. Historically, wet markets in Hong Kong were open‐air affairs that relied entirely on natural ventilation—a design well suited to the humid subtropical climate\cite{1}. These early market buildings, constructed predominantly in the 1970s and 1980s, were designed with high ceilings, open layouts, and porous building envelopes that facilitated efficient air movement and heat dissipation\cite{1,2}. Over time, MSBs evolved into mixed‐use complexes that served not only as market spaces but also as communal hubs in densely populated neighborhoods, reinforcing their role as civic anchors\cite{3}.
    
    The introduction of Cooked Food Centers (CFCs) in the 1970s marked a further development in these markets. CFCs were established to improve hygiene standards for street food vendors and were often incorporated into the upper floors of MSBs. This design maintained the benefits of natural ventilation while attempting to manage cooking fumes through mechanical exhaust systems\cite{2,3}. However, as public expectations evolved and the demand for modern indoor environments increased, there has been a growing trend toward retrofitting these semi‐open CFCs. Recent pilot retrofit projects have converted these spaces into fully sealed, actively cooled, supermarket‐like environments\cite{4}.

    Such retrofits, while intended to enhance thermal control and meet stricter hygiene regulations, introduce unintended consequences. By closing the building envelope and relying solely on active cooling, these retrofits reduce the natural ventilation that originally helped dilute contaminants and maintain a comfortable microclimate\cite{4,5}. This shift can lead to degraded ventilation performance, as evidenced by elevated $CO_2$ levels, and an increase in energy consumption due to the additional sensible and latent cooling load required. The challenge for engineers and architects is to balance modernization with the preservation of the cultural and functional essence of these historically vibrant, semi‐open spaces.

\subsection{$CO_2$ as a Diagnostic Tool}
    The COVID-19 pandemic has sharpened our focus on indoor air quality and brought renewed attention to ventilation performance in densely occupied environments. In many studies, $CO_2$ concentration has been used as a practical proxy for ventilation performance and occupant density\cite{17}. In the context of Hong Kong’s MSBs, $CO_2$ measurements are not only indicators of air quality but also reflect the broader impacts of retrofitting—from changes in building enclosure to shifts in social interaction patterns. Rising $CO_2$ levels in sealed, actively cooled CFCs signal that reduced natural ventilation may compromise the spaces’ original function as open, community-oriented environments\cite{8,15}.
    
    Traditional ventilation assessments, which rely on continuous monitoring over long periods, often fail to capture the dynamic nature of semi‑open spaces such as wet markets. In these settings, short‐burst $CO_2$ measurements provide snapshots of how ventilation changes with occupancy and external conditions. When a retrofit converts a semi‑open space into a fully enclosed, mechanically cooled environment, the natural dilution of exhaled $CO_2$ is hindered. Thus, elevated $CO_2$ levels become a diagnostic marker for both diminished air exchange and potential design inferiority in the retrofit strategy\cite{16}. This is especially relevant in MSBs, where the balance between energy efficiency, thermal comfort, and sufficient ventilation is critical. It's important to note that such snapshot measurements capture only a momentary picture of ventilation performance and may be influenced by transient fluctuations in occupancy and outdoor conditions. Consequently, while this approach offers valuable diagnostic insight, supplementing it with longer-term monitoring could further validate the observed trends.
    
    Our study leverages $CO_2$ monitoring as a quantitative method to assess these changes as its concentration has been suggested as a helpful proxy indicator for indoor air quality (IAQ) and ventilation adequacy\cite{persily1997co2}.
    Comparing $CO_2$ concentrations in MSBs with central air conditioning to those in mixed-mode, naturally ventilated markets—alongside control measurements from nearby shopping malls—helps isolate the effects of design modifications on ventilation performance. This approach addresses a significant gap in retrofit evaluations by using $CO_2$ not only as an indoor air quality metric but also as an indicator of the underlying changes in airflow dynamics brought on by modernization efforts\cite{15,17}. In doing so, our method offers a practical tool for diagnosing the unintended costs of closing up these culturally significant, semi‑open spaces.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:sample1}
\subsection{Site selection}

Hong Kong currently has a total of 43 Municipal Services Buildings (MSB) spanning across its various districts, with 33 of them containing wet markets. In 2018, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government launched the "Market Modernization Program" and decided to install air conditioning in MSBs to improve the indoor environment\cite{19}. In order to investigate whether these retrofit measures can effectively enhance indoor air quality and create a more pleasant indoor environment, this study examined various MSBs and ultimately selected three of the most representative ones: Aberdeen Municipal Services Building (AB), Kowloon City Municipal Services Building (KL), and Kwun Chong Municipal Services Building (KC), as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ab,kl,kc}. For each of the targeted MSB building that we identified, we also looked for its control benchmark, a shopping mall within its close proximity as can be seen from Figure~\ref{fig:ab-ref}.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{map3.jpg}
    \caption{Location of Aberdeen MSB, Kowloon City MSB, and Kwun Chong MSB on map}

    \caption{Location of Aberdeen MSB on map against its reference building closeby}
    \label{fig:ab-ref}
\end{figure}

The Aberdeen Municipal Services Building, established in 1983 as Hong Kong's first, features a wet market, library, offices, sports facilities, and an exhibition center across its seven stories. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:transition-ab}, the previous building façade was semi-open, facilitating effective indoor air circulation through mixed-mode ventilation and direct openings to the external environment. In contrast, the post-retrofit façade is fully enclosed, with the internal environment now regulated by a newly installed active cooling system. The other two buildings selected—the Kowloon City Municipal Services Building (1988) and the Kwun Chung Municipal Building (1991)—were constructed around the same time as the Aberdeen MSB, sharing similar architectural and functional characteristics. Like the Aberdeen MSB, these buildings utilize a combination of natural and mechanical ventilation for their wet markets. While the Kowloon City MSB is currently awaiting renovation, the Kwun Chung market is nearly abandoned and slated for conversion into an 'urban sports center,' accommodating activities such as rock climbing, breakdancing, and skateboarding.

%Initially semi-open, the wet market was later transformed into a closed area with a modern centralized air conditioning system as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:transition-ab}. Notably in the image, the façade got completely closed up after the retrofit, and what previously was a mix-mode ventilated space with direct openings to the outside air now has all of the internal environment handled by a completely new active-cooling system. Similar in function to Aberdeen MSB, the Kowloon City Municipal Services Building (1988) and Kwun Chung Municipal Building (1991) use natural and mechanical ventilation for their wet markets. Kowloon City MSB is awaiting retrofit, while Kwun Chung market is nearly abandoned and will be converted into an 'urban sports center' for activities like rock climbing, breakdancing, and skateboarding. The other two yet-to-be-retrofitted buildings were selected as they were built around the same time with the Aberdeen MSB with comparable urban footprint while providing local residents valuable access to fresh groceries and produce.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Experiment Setup}%Consider squeezing the temperature outdoor/indoor here. 

    In order to compare the differences in indoor environmental conditions between the retrofitted and unretrofitted MSBs, a total of three rounds of experiments were conducted, collecting environmental parameters at typical locations in the wet market, including air temperature ($T_a$), relative humdity (RH), $CO_2$ concentration, air velocity ($v_a$), barometric pressure ($P_a$), and PM2.5 concentration. The sensors and their corresponding specs can be found in Table ~\ref{tab:protocols} below. As the floor plans from all MSB markets are a part of the government records whose copies are not made available for download but rather for read access only, we only obtained floor plan that has a high-enough resolution for the Aberdeen market from an architectural archive as in Figure~\ref{fig:ab-floorplan}, where each of the gray dots point to one of the four locations measured for each round on the two stories covered.

    The sensing of $CO_2$, in the meantime, saw itself developing much further from expensive and slow-responding and expensive NDIR (non-dispersive infrared) "photometric" sensors to cheaper alternatives that are photoacoustic. Not only has these new alternatives pushed the price down to monitor $CO_2$ levels, the settling time has also drastically decreased from several days\cite{emmerich2005} to tens of minutes\cite{fisk2008} to as fast as 1min only\cite{sensirion2021,sensirion_scd4x_nodate}. Comparing the two technology, NDIR sensors typically settle faster since the measurement of $CO_2$ is in open-air optical path rather than relying on gas diffusion into a sealed chamber. Nonetheless, for low-cost sensors, low-cost variants like SCD41 (as this study deploys) has high accuracy within 400-5000 PPM for $CO_2$, is compliant with California Title24, RESET and WELL standards for buildings\cite{senseair2020,sensirion2021}. With its compatibility to common IAQ/building standards, we selectedc the SCD41 sensor due to its lower cost (well below 50 USD when purchased in bulk), reasonable response time and compact form factor to work with the developer boards.

    Four SCD41 sensors were first subjected to an initial round of calibration in an open environment, followed by a consistency verification in a sealed office environment, to ensure the accuracy and comparability of measurement data\cite{28}. This step was completed in the Lung Fu Shan area at a location characterized by good air circulation due to its elevation on Hong Kong Island (approximately 110 meters above sea level). For the calibration, the necessary preparations included the SCD41 sensors, a standard $CO_2$ sensor, and laptop supporting WebSerial. Initially, the SCD41 sensors were connected to the laptop, and the corresponding serial device was selected and connected via the WebSerial webpage. The "nRF Connect for Mobile" application was then used to monitor $CO_2$ concentration to ensure continuous reading is coming in real-time. We aspired to avoid obstruction of an outer casing so opted for socket-ready IoT board as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:equipment-setup} where no additional structure interferes with the measurements from $CO_2$ and other iEQ sensors.

    \begin{figure}[h]

        \caption{Sensors hooked up to IoT board as getting prepared for initial round of measurements.}
        \label{fig:equipment-setup}
    \end{figure}
    
    For instance, when the standard sensor indicated a $CO_2$ concentration of 400 ppm\cite{29}, the command “cal\_$CO_2$ 400” was entered into the WebSerial application to initiate the calibration. Upon completion, the sensor returned a confirmation of successful calibration. Post-calibration, four SCD41 sensors along with the standard $CO_2$ sensor were placed together in a sealed plastic bag to further verify the accuracy of their readings. In this enclosed environment, the sensor readings gradually converged towards the standard sensor's value, ultimately maintaining a deviation within 20 ppm. This step ensured the accuracy of the sensors after calibration. 
    
    Subsequently, another calibration was performed in a sealed office environment to validate the consistency of the sensor readings. Four SCD41 sensors and the standard $CO_2$ sensor were prepared, and a sealed office space was selected to maintain stable environmental conditions during the test. The sensors were placed in the same location within the office to ensure they were exposed to the same air condition.The sensors were then allowed to operate for an extended period, with continuous measurement data being recorded. A comparison of the readings from the four SCD41 sensors using the mobile application "nRF Connect for Mobile" revealed that the sensor readings were consistent, confirming the comparability of the experimental results.

    All sensors from Table~\ref{tab:protocols} were configured to sample data continuously during each measurement session. In Round I, data were collected at a rate of 1 sample per second. In Rounds II and III, the sensors recorded data every 10 seconds; effectively, these rounds produced data that are averaged over 10-second intervals. To ensure consistency across all rounds, the Round I data were post-processed by averaging over 10-second intervals, thereby harmonizing the sampling methodology. Moreover, each location was monitored for a fixed duration—15 minutes in Rounds I and II, and 10 minutes in Round III—with an additional 5-minute outdoor measurement taken prior to each session. These measures were implemented to minimize variability due to differences in sampling rates and to ensure that the observed differences in $CO_2$ and other iEQ metrics are attributable primarily to the building system design rather than to measurement timing or occupancy fluctuations.
    
    The first round of the experiment took place on March 26, 2024, from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m., with the highest temperature recorded at 28°C. Utilizing a set of sensors from an Arduino kit\cite{30}, including the SCD41 $CO_2$ sensor ($\pm$50ppm), DHT22 temperature and RH sensor ($\pm$0.5°C, $\pm$2\% ), FS3000-1005 air speed sensor (5\%), and BME280 $P_a$ sensor ($\pm$0.1kPa), measurements were taken at a height of 1.2 meters\cite{31}. At each location, sensors were activated, data recorded, then deactivated before moving on. This round of the experiment covered 17 locations within four buildings, including the Aberdeen and Kwun Chong MSBs and their adjacent shopping malls.
    
    As the initial round of experiment only revealed the relationship between the indoor and outdoor environment within the CFC buildings identified, we conducted two additional rounds of experiments respectively on October 17, 2024, from 5:00 to 8:00 p.m., and on October 23, 2024, from 3:00 to 5:00 p.m., where highest air temperatures reached 30°C and 27°C. These rounds utilized an improved sensor kit, measuring temperature, relative RH, and $CO_2$ with the SCD41 sensor ($\pm$50ppm, $\pm$0.5°C, $\pm$2), differential $P_a$ and air speed with the SDP810 sensor ($\pm$500Pa), barometric $P_a$ with the BMP380 sensor ($\pm$0.5hPa), and PM 2.5 with the SEN54 sensor ($\pm$10\%). Upon inspecting the data collected, we noticed Kwun Chong, despite being very well-ventilated did not have as high a population density as was seen in Aberdeen against its control case shopping malls, hence we proceeded to include a third market, Kowloon City into our subsequent measurements.
    
    In the second round, sensors were fixed on tripods at a height of 1.5 meters, while in the third round, they were placed on the side of a backpack at a height of approximately 1 to 1.2 meters\cite{32}. Each location was monitored for 15 minutes, with the sensors continuously recording data. In the third round, the time spent at each measurement location was reduced to 10 minutes, and outdoor climate conditions were measured for 5 minutes outside each building before the experiment began.
    
    The latter two rounds included the Kowloon City MSB, measuring a total of 24 points within six buildings. These locations encompassed areas with significant differences in air quality within each building\cite{33}, such as entry and exit points, air conditioning vents or fans at the lowest levels, and areas with the most or least crowded populations. These measurements allowed for the observation of significant differences in $CO_2$ concentration within the buildings.
    
\subsection{Post-Processing of Data Collected}
    Once the measurement was done, we consolidated the measurement records from all three rounds of measurements into a larger dataset. We also created additional columns with known traits such as measurement of the outdoor environment (`outdoor') as well as the state of movement of the occupants (`moving'). Any transient fluctuations in $CO_2$ readings observed during the initial 30 seconds of sensor activation were excluded from the analysis to ensure that only stable, representative data were used. Meanwhile, The settling effect is a known phenomenon in field measurements, where sensor readings initially fluctuate before stabilizing\cite{fradenHandbookModernSensors2016}. By carefully calibrating the sensors and excluding transient data from the analysis, we ensured that only stable, reliable iEQ measurements were used to diagnose ventilation performance. We also mapped the system type of various buildings to two different types: `mixed' and `active', pointing to respectively buildings that are equipped with either almost all-natural ventilation (with a slight enhancement from mechanical ventilation) or active cooling system i.e. air-conditioning. 
    
    To quantify the additional energy demands introduced by retrofitting semi-open markets into fully sealed, actively cooled environments, we performed simplified cooling load estimations following standard HVAC calculation methods (ASHRAE guidelines). Specifically, we estimated sensible and latent cooling loads using assumptions of air changes per hour (ACH = 6), an assumed ceiling height (3 meters), temperature differences ($\Delta T$ ranging from 4–8 K), and humidity ratio differences ($\Delta \omega $ from 0.005–0.010 kg water/kg air). Detailed analytical calculations, sensitivity considerations, and resulting energy estimates are comprehensively presented and discussed in the discussion section of this paper. As most of the calculation are rule-based following explicit equations, they are kept in the discussions section for coherence.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Indoor Environmental Measurements ($CO_2$,$T_a$, RH, PM2.5 and Air velocity)}
We consolidated indoor environmental quality (IEQ) measurements collected across three rounds of experiments conducted in three representative Municipal Service Buildings (MSBs): Aberdeen (AB), Kowloon City (KL), and Kwun Chong (KC). Specifically, we report measured concentrations of carbon dioxide ($CO_2$), air temperature ($T_a$), relative humidity (RH), particulate matter (PM2.5), and air velocity ($v_a$). Figure~\ref{fig:TaRHva} summarizes the measured Ta, RH, and va, showing clear variations between buildings utilizing active cooling and those employing mixed-mode ventilation. Notably, actively cooled buildings exhibited significantly lower temperatures and air velocities, with Aberdeen displaying consistently lower air velocity and higher humidity relative to Kowloon City and Kwun Chong.

        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/TaRHva.png}
        \caption{Violinplot of air temperature, relative humidity and air velocity across multiple locations and rounds of experiments (KL was not measured in Round I so is missing across all three plots.)}
        \label{fig:TaRHva}
    \end{figure}

The resulting Figure~\ref{fig:TaRHva} summarizes the measured air temperature, relative humidity and air velocity across the three MSBs. Air temperature measurements indicate a distinct cooling effect in actively cooled environments, with temperatures consistently lower than outdoor conditions, while buildings relying on mixed-mode ventilation (e.g., KC and KL) exhibited higher and more variable indoor temperatures. Relative humidity showed greater variability, particularly influenced by occupancy and activities within each building (e.g., cooking processes), with Aberdeen generally maintaining higher humidity levels potentially driven by their cooling system of choice. Air velocity measurements further reveal notable differences: Aberdeen consistently presented the lowest velocities, suggesting less air movement, whereas Kowloon City and Kwun Chong demonstrated higher and more variable air velocities indicative of more dynamic airflow patterns.

    \label{fig:$CO_2$-types-meas}
\end{figure}


Moving on to our next parameter of interests, $CO_2$, Figure~\ref{fig:$CO_2$-types-meas} presents the measured $CO_2$ concentrations across various locations and rounds of measurements, comparing the three primary test buildings (AB, KC, KL) and their corresponding reference buildings (REF\_AB, REF\_KC, REF\_KL). In the unit of X axis of upper plot, each colored curve represents the distribution of $CO_2$ within each building, revealing distinct concentration patterns. Notably, the Aberdeen (AB) building shows a narrower and distinctly shifted peak, reflecting consistently elevated $CO_2$ levels relative to Kowloon City (KL) and Kwun Chong (KC). Quantitatively, the average $CO_2$ concentration within the retrofitted Aberdeen building is approximately 216 ppm higher than its mixed-mode ventilated counterparts. The lower scatter plot additionally compares measured $CO_2$ concentrations against air velocities ($v_a$), indicating Aberdeen’s $CO_2$ concentrations generally cluster in higher ranges with comparatively lower air velocities than KC and KL.

% In the upper density plot in Figure~\ref{fig:$CO_2$-types-meas}, each colored curve corresponds to one building’s $CO_2$ distribution. We can see that the three primary test buildings (AB, KC, and KL) have relatively narrow, more peaked curves, indicating that within each building, $CO_2$ concentrations tend to cluster tightly around a specific range. In contrast, the reference buildings (labeled REF\_AB, REF\_KC, REF\_KL) show wider or flatter distributions, meaning $CO_2$ levels vary more broadly and are less centered on one particular $CO_2$ value.

% Among the test buildings, AB stands out: its peak is shifted to a different $CO_2$ range compared to KC and KL. This suggests that AB’s occupancy patterns or ventilation behavior leads to a distinctly different “signature” of $CO_2$ concentrations than the other two test buildings. Quantitatively, this translates to an increase of $CO_2$ by 216 PPM within the dataset that we collected for the retrofitted CFC at AB. This difference widens to 219 if we include the reference buildings selected as well.

% In the lower scatter plot, the x‐axis shows measured $CO_2$ (in parts per million) while the y‐axis is the measured air velocity. Each point is colored according to the building it came from, so we can visually compare how the same buildings with distinct $CO_2$ distributions (as seen in the top chart) also differ in air velocity. Clusters of points that stay in a particular $CO_2$ region with lower or higher air velocity can indicate how often a building experiences certain ventilation rates or occupant load. Overall, AB has a separate band of $CO_2$ readings (compared to KC and KL), consistent with its more distinct distribution in the density plot.

% \subsubsection{Particulate Levels}

We also compared the particulates level differences across different buildings and locations/rounds of measurements as plotted out in Figure~\ref{fig:PMVals}. Despite different types of reference building systems, it is clear that the particulates level within the CFCs fluctuates across a much wider range across various sizes from PM 1.0 through PM 10.0, amongst which we picked PM2.5 to plot in Figure~\ref{fig:PMVals} as a well-recognized Particulate Matter metric.
    
    \begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{img/air_pm.png}
    \caption{Scatterplot of PM2.5 levels (PPM) versus air velocity. Marker colors indicate system type, with blue markers representing mixed-mode ventilation (KC, KL) and black markers representing measurements from active cooling systems (AB)}\label{fig:PMVals}
    \end{figure}

Observing Figure~\ref{fig:PMVals}, it clearly shows actively cooled environments (AB) exhibit higher variability and generally elevated PM2.5 concentrations, especially at lower air velocities. In contrast, mixed-mode ventilation systems (blue markers) typically demonstrate lower PM2.5 concentrations, coupled with relatively higher and more variable air velocities. This visual comparison underscores distinct differences in particulate matter handling between the two ventilation system types, with actively cooled systems frequently showing elevated PM2.5 levels despite stable, lower air velocities.

To better understand the relationship between different environmental parameters and how well they represent the ventilation effectiveness, we compared within our collected data their perason correlation coefficient as well as $R^2$ in the following Figure~\ref{fig:trianglescatter}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{img/aircorr.png}\includegraphics[width=0.55\linewidth]{img/co2scatter.png}
    \caption{Pearson Correlation Coefficient of relevant iEQ measured against air velocity (left) and scattered plot of them against air velocity with linear regression lines (right).}
    \label{fig:trianglescatter}
\end{figure}

Across all measured parameters, carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) demonstrated the clearest inverse relationship with air velocity, as shown in both the scatter plots and the correlation matrix in Figure~\ref{fig:trianglescatter}. $CO_2$ concentrations exhibited a moderately negative correlation with air velocity (r = -0.306), translating to an $R^2$ of 0.094—substantially higher than other environmental variables such as PM2.5 ($R^2$ $\approx$ 0.026), PM1.0 ($R^2$ $\approx $ 0.026), or the VOC index ($R^2$ $\approx$ 0.014). These patterns suggest that air velocity, as a proxy for natural ventilation, has a more consistent and interpretable effect on $CO_2$ dilution than on pollutant concentrations, which tend to vary based on source, filtration, and other environmental factors.

This result affirms $CO_2$’s value as a primary diagnostic indicator for ventilation effectiveness in semi-public environments. Unlike particulate matter, which may reflect localized emissions or filtration dynamics, $CO_2$ concentrations are more directly linked to human occupancy and air exchange rates. The higher degree of statistical alignment between $CO_2$ and air velocity allows us to quantitatively assess the cost of reduced ventilation in retrofitted spaces—specifically, the buildup of exhaled air due to diminished airflow. This relationship forms the basis for interpreting ventilation efficiency and energy trade-offs in subsequent analyses.
% Our analysis of PM2.5 levels in relation to air velocity reveals a distinct pattern between mixed-mode ventilation (MMV) and active cooling systems (ACS). We observed that higher PM values were more frequently present in ACS, suggesting that these systems may struggle to handle high concentrations of PM. This is likely due to the fixed capacity of ACS, which limits their ability to maintain air velocity as PM levels increase. In contrast, MMV systems demonstrated a greater ability to introduce fresh air and lower PM levels, indicating that they are more effective at filtering out pollutants.

% A closer examination of the data suggests that ACS may be effective in filtering out some PM2.5 particles, particularly at lower concentrations. However, when faced with higher PM values, these systems appear to become overwhelmed, resulting in higher levels of particulate matter. This is a crucial finding, as it implies that ACS should not be used as the sole means of air filtration in densely populated areas or environments where high levels of PM are expected. On the other hand, MMV systems demonstrated a more consistent ability to introduce fresh air and reduce PM levels, making them an attractive option for applications requiring improved indoor air quality.

% To better understand these findings, it is helpful to visualize the relationship between PM2.5 levels and air velocity across both systems as we are showing in Figure~\ref{fig:PMVals} where we plot the data on a scatterplot with PM2.5 PPM values on the y-axis and air velocity on the x-axis. This would allow us to examine the splattering pattern of PM2.5 values against air velocity, providing insight into how different air velocities affect PM levels in each system. The color of the markers in the scatterplot indicates the system type, with blue markers representing MMV and black markers representing ACS. By examining the distribution of PM2.5 levels across different air velocities, we can gain a better understanding of how each system handles PM filtration and identify potential areas for improvement.

\subsection{Calculated Parameters: From Heat Stress to Thermal Comfort}

Beyond wet bulb temperature, the first actual indice of thermal stress that we want to examine is UTCI, which provides us a quantitative measure to how the thermal stress is being experienced by the occupants through the measured space\cite{35}. One of its core benefit is that it stretches across multiple heat stress categories from the numerical calculation fo the temperature-like UTCI values. The environment that we are investigating also do not go beyond the acceptable range of environmental conditions for UTCI, as the CFC centers do not have extreme values that tend to skew the UTCI calculation due to numerical instability in contributing to the polynomial equations in computing UTCI values. On that front, we leveraged the pythermalcomfort package\cite{36}, which allows for calculating UTCI through empirical formulations and regression models in calculating UTCI values.

\begin{figure}[h!]

Figure ~\ref{fig:heatstress-breakdown} presents distributions of calculated wet bulb temperatures across the three Municipal Service Buildings (Aberdeen, Kowloon City, and Kwun Chong) and their adjacent reference buildings. Wet bulb temperatures are categorized according to established heat stress levels. That is moderate, strong, very strong according to the UTCI classes they below to in order to better understand the resulting wet bulb glob temperature's meaning, allowing for highlighting variations in occupant heat stress experiences. Aberdeen displays distinctly lower wet bulb temperatures compared to Kowloon City and Kwun Chong, with most measurements categorized within lower heat stress ranges. In contrast, Kowloon City and Kwun Chong exhibit consistently higher wet bulb temperatures, frequently categorized within “strong” or “very strong” heat stress ranges. Notably, adjacent reference buildings exhibit systematically lower wet bulb temperatures than their corresponding market buildings, suggesting differences in microclimatic conditions within closely situated building environments. 




% \subsection{Calculated Parameters:From Wet Bulb Temperatures to PMV/PPD and PET}
% % \subsubsection{Wet Bulb Temperature and Heat Stress}
% As we outlined in our methodology, we also want to examine other calculated parameters from the environmental condition measurements that we collected. The first of set of comparison that we want to compare the web bulb temperature that we could calculate from the measured air temperature, relative humidiity and barometric pressure. On top of which, as we estimate the mean radiant temperature to be equal to the air temperature as their access to sunlight was extremely limited across all locations, we assumed the mean radiant temperature equals the air temperature due to limited sunlight exposure.\cite{34}. 

% % Beyond wet bulb temperature, the first actual indice of thermal stress that we want to examine is UTCI, which provides us a quantitative measure to how the thermal stress is being experienced by the occupants through the measured space\cite{35}. One of its core benefit is that it stretches across multiple heat stress categories from the numerical calculation fo the temperature-like UTCI values. The environment that we are investigating also do not go beyond the acceptable range of environmental conditions for UTCI, as the CFC centers do not have extreme values that tend to skew the UTCI calculation due to numerical instability in contributing to the polynomial equations in computing UTCI values. On that front, we leveraged the pythermalcomfort package\cite{36}, which allows for calculating UTCI through empirical formulations and regression models in calculating UTCI values.

% This allowed us to compute the following comaprison for each of the CFC to be compared to its reference commercial buildings with respect to the wet bulb temperature distribution and the categories of heat stress that occupants would be expecting with respect to various wet bulb temperature. Recognizing wet bulb temperature as proxy of humidity and temperature, they inherently captures critical factors in determining PET\cite{37}. Plotting wet bulb temperature across the PET categories from our calculations allows us to reveal how specific microclimates wihtin each of the investigated building conditions contribute to heat stress. More explicitly, this allows us to actively compare numerically how the building environment varies against each other within obvious adjacency spatially (as each reference building was selected immediately next to the CFC), and how they comapre against each other.

%     \caption{Heat Stress Category Experience expressed by wet bulb temperature}
%     \label{fig:heatstress-breakdown}
% \end{figure}

% A few very interesting observation one could make about Figure~\ref{fig:heatstress-breakdown} is how much lower the wet bulb temperature is compared to KL and KC, and how much of the environment that our measurement captured was categorically different in terms of thermal stress within AB and KC/KL. This appears to be supporting the notion that there needs to be a continuous modernization effort to allow for improved thermal comfort and much more 'modernized' Cooked Food Center in Municipal Service Buildings. However, another interesting observation we could make is about the attenuation of thermal stress that we could see within each of the subplots across all three CFCs. Interestingly, their reference (REF) buildings exhibit a clear attenuation of thermal stress, transitioning from “very strong” to “strong” or “moderate” categories. This implies that localized environmental factors or design features (e.g., shading or airflow) are naturally mitigating heat stress in these reference structures. This disparity might suggest that KL and KC require targeted retrofitting to bring them closer to acceptable thermal conditions. The attenuation seen in their REF buildings could guide interventions, highlighting the need for passive strategies like improved ventilation and solar shading over excessive cooling measures like those seen in AB. These findings emphasize that thoughtful modernization, rather than blanket cooling, is critical for achieving sustainable thermal comfort.
% Figure “Measured wet bulb temperatures across buildings within various rounds” illustrates the distribution of wet bulb globe temperatures in different buildings during the three experimental rounds. It is evident that in buildings with mixed ventilation, such as Kowloon City Wet Market and Kwun Chong Wet Market, their wet bulb globe temperatures are significantly higher than those in buildings controlled by central air conditioning, such as Aberdeen Wet Market and nearby shopping malls. This indicates that such outdated ventilation methods may lead to greater heat stimulation, making individuals feel uncomfortable. Comparing Kowloon City and nearby shopping malls during the same time period, the wet bulb globe temperature is higher in the second round and similar in the third round. This is because the central air conditioning in the reference building was not operational during the third experiment, resulting in a noticeable increase in indoor wet bulb globe temperature, contributing to discomfort among occupants and demonstrating the significant role of central air conditioning in reducing wet bulb temperature.

% The introduction of central air conditioning helps lower and stabilize the indoor wet bulb temperature at a comfortable level. However, in buildings with mixed ventilation, the indoor wet bulb temperature remains unstable and is susceptible to temporal and geographical influences. As seen in the figures, the wet bulb temperatures in Aberdeen MSB and the nearby reference building show minimal differences across the three experimental rounds, with only slight fluctuations within a small range, whereas Kowloon City and Kwun Chong exhibit significant differences in wet bulb temperatures during multiple experiments. Both being mixed ventilation buildings, Kowloon City and Kwun Chong are situated in different urban layouts, with Kowloon City being more open and less dominated by high-rise buildings, while Kwun Chong is located in a crowded city center, leading to noticeable variations in indoor wet bulb temperatures between the two.

% Therefore, from the perspective of the impact of heat stress on individuals, the introduction of central air conditioning systems is essential to lower indoor wet bulb temperature, enhance evaporative heat exchange between the body and the environment, improve comfort within the MSB, attract more customers, and increase the convenience of daily life for residents in the surrounding neighborhoods.

% \subsubsection{Predicted Mean Vote (PMV)  and Thermal Comfort}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{COST_COMF.png}
    \caption{Predicted Mean Vote, Percentage of People Dissatisfied and Physiological Equivalent Temperature Calculated across all locations measured.}
    \label{fig:pmv3}
\end{figure}

Similarly, Figure~\ref{fig:pmv3} summarizes calculated thermal comfort indices—Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), Percentage of People Dissatisfied (PPD), and Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) across all measurement locations and rounds. Aberdeen, the actively retrofitted building, is highlighted separately alongside mixed-mode ventilated buildings (KC, KL) and reference actively cooled buildings. The PMV values for Aberdeen frequently exceed recommended thresholds ($\pm$0.5), indicating occupants experience conditions beyond optimal thermal comfort ranges. Similarly, Aberdeen’s PPD consistently surpasses the recommended dissatisfaction limit (10\%), suggesting higher potential occupant dissatisfaction relative to mixed-mode ventilated buildings. Additionally, PET values indicate Aberdeen’s indoor thermal conditions frequently fall outside the recommended comfort band (26–28$\degree C$), typically skewed towards lower PET values, indicating cooler indoor conditions relative to its mixed-mode counterparts.

% Similarly, we also proceed to evaluate the PMV values\cite{38} across the entire history of locations we measured, including CFCs and their corresponding reference buildings, thus obtaining Figure~\ref{fig:pmv3} where we compare the PMV, PPD and PET from each of the buildings across all rounds of measurements. We have highlighted the retrofitted building, AB explicitly with grey highlight, and separated the mixed-mode ventilation (MMV) buildings (KC, KL) and the rest of actively-cooled buildings with a vertical red line in the image itself.

% We generated this image to illustrate how Building AB’s indoor comfort performance (as reflected in PMV, PPD, and PET) has evolved compared to its pre‐retrofit mixed‐mode counterparts (KC and KL) and to show its proximity to the actively‐cooled reference buildings. The magenta dashed lines represent recommended comfort thresholds, while the gray dashed lines indicate more lenient or “loosened” limits for each metric. The vertical red line separates the mixed‐mode buildings on the left (KC, KL, and AB) from the actively‐cooled references on the right, and the light gray shading denotes the subset of retrofitted cases. From these boxen plots, we can see that after retrofitting, AB’s comfort values moved closer to the reference buildings’ ranges—despite the fact that the references were neither market nor occupant‐type matches for AB—suggesting that the interventions on AB effectively improved its thermal conditions to a level on par with or approaching those of actively‐cooled buildings.

% Examining the plot further, we see that AB’s retrofitted performance still tends to drift outside the recommended thermal comfort bands more often than its non‐retrofitted counterparts. Specifically, PMV values for AB are frequently beyond the magenta lines (i.e., $\pm$0.5), indicating that occupants experience more time either warmer or cooler than the target neutral zone. Likewise, a majority of AB’s PPD results exceed the 10\% threshold line (also in magenta), signaling higher dissatisfaction compared to its sister markets (KC and KL), which generally remain closer to or below that 10\% limit. In contrast, if we look at PET (the lower panel), AB appears to be within or near the 26–28 $\degree C$ range only intermittently, and more often it diverges—suggesting overcooling conditions in certain rounds. Overall, while the retrofit did bring AB's performance somewhat closer to the reference buildings, these data highlight that the building still faces comfort issues—particularly elevated PMV and PPD—and at times it may even be cooled beyond the local recommended PET zone.

% The thermal comfort in buildings with central air conditioning is generally more comfortable and stable compared to buildings with mixed ventilation. Figure~\ref{fig:pmv3} shows PMV values across buildings during the three experimental rounds, revealing that centrally air-conditioned buildings consistently have PMV values below 0, while mixed-ventilation buildings typically exceed 0, indicating cooler and more comfortable conditions in the former. The figure also indicates that PMV values in Aberdeen and the reference building remain stable between -2 and 0. Moreover, in the second round of the Kowloon City reference building and the third round of the Kwun Tong reference building, PMV values stabilize around 0, reflecting a neutral and highly comfortable environment that is particularly appealing. PMV values in buildings with mixed ventilation saw much more significant fluctuations in contrast. Although the PMV values in the second round of experiments in Kowloon City Wet Market and the third round of experiments in Kwun Chong Wet Market are close to 0, reaching a comfortable state, the PMV values in other rounds reach 3 or even 5. This may be due to the high humidity within the wet markets, creating a hot and uncomfortable environment.

% Therefore, from the perspective of thermal comfort, the thermal environment in buildings with central air conditioning and ventilation is more stable and comfortable, while the thermal comfort in buildings with mixed ventilation is more susceptible to interference from natural environmental factors. Therefore, considering thermal comfort, the addition of central air conditioning can effectively enhance thermal comfort for individuals, increase the willingness of nearby residents to visit, and thus, it is necessary to carry out retrofit to transform more MSBs into buildings with central air conditioning and ventilation.


% \subsection{Temporal  and spatial variation of the indoor air quality }
% \subsubsection{Temporal variation of $CO_2$ concentration}

% The changes in $CO_2$ concentration over time during the second and third rounds of experiments are respectively shown in Figure Round “II” and “III”. In both rounds of experiments, the $CO_2$ concentration in Aberdeen Wet Market is significantly higher than in Kowloon City and Kwun Chong, indicating that the indoor air quality of the central air-conditioned MSB after retrofit is not as good as that of the mixed-ventilation MSB. From the figures, it can be observed that the sensor readings abruptly increase upon reaching a new location, then gradually decrease to a stable value. During the walking process, the $CO_2$ concentration fluctuates continuously until stabilizing upon reaching a new location. In the second round of experiments, the $CO_2$ concentration in Aberdeen remains around 700 ppm, while in the third round, the air quality in Aberdeen improves, stabilizing around 600 ppm. The two wet markets with mixed ventilation maintain indoor $CO_2$ concentrations at around 400 ppm due to natural ventilation, indicating good indoor air quality. However, in the second round of experiments, the fourth location in Kowloon City, which is the cooked food center, experiences significantly elevated $CO_2$ levels due to crowded human traffic and steam from hotpots, highlighting the lack of natural ventilation and decreased indoor air quality in that area. The $CO_2$ concentration in the Reference building can reach up to 800 ppm, higher than in the retrofitted Aberdeen, possibly because the MSB is relatively outdated with lower foot traffic, resulting in less air pollution and slightly better indoor air quality compared to the shopping malls. The third round of experiments took place on a weekday afternoon, leading to occasional $CO_2$ concentrations below 400 ppm, especially in Kwun Chong Wet Market, which is nearly deserted, resulting in lower $CO_2$ levels due to the lack of customers.

% \begin{figure}[h!]

%     \caption{Temporal change of measured $CO_2$ levels across buildings measured for Round 2 (upper) and Round 3 (lower) of measurements}
%     \label{fig:temporal-$CO_2$}
% \end{figure}

% We noticed a couple of interesting phenomena with measurements from Figure~\ref{fig:temporal-$CO_2$}. Following a field experiment protocol, we began measurements at CFCs before moving to actively cooled reference commercial buildings. Despite changes in the outdoor environment, $CO_2$ levels remained consistent across both measurement rounds. The two mixed-mode ventilated CFCs registered $CO_2$ levels around 400 ppm, while the Aberdeen CFC consistently maintained levels near 650 ppm. Moreover, within both rounds of experiment, there is an interesting uptilt of $CO_2$ levels that we observed from moving between measurement locations. For Round II, this happened clearly when we moved to a heavily populated canteen area with very dense occupancy and somewhat poor ventilation where we recorded an average 716 PPM during the 15 minutes of measurement time at that location. For Round III, a similar upward trend was observed when we moved from the mix-mode ventilated KC CFC to a nearby commercial building for reference. Here, within the 15 minutes of measurement at correspoding locations, we recorded an average $CO_2$ level of 623 PPM, which also contrasted significantly from what one could visually examine to be regressing around 400 PPM of $CO_2$ level within both CFC that got measured as according to the image within Figure~\ref{fig:temporal-$CO_2$}.

% \subsubsection{Spatial variation of $CO_2$ concentration}

% When comparing the carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) concentrations at the entrances of the three MSBs, it was observed that, despite efforts to introduce some fresh air, the levels of $CO_2$ at the entrance of the AC Wet Market were found to be significantly higher than those at the entrance of the NV Wet Market. This disparity suggests that the reliance on air conditioning systems may contribute to a decline in indoor air quality within the market environment. Furthermore, it was noted that variations in $CO_2$ measurements at the same location were influenced by the fluctuations in customer traffic levels at different times of the day. The presence of fresh air intake led to notable fluctuations in the overall air quality parameters within the market premises, highlighting the dynamic nature of indoor air quality management in such commercial settings.

%     \begin{figure}[h!]

%         \label{fig:$CO_2$-spatial-loc1}
%     \end{figure}

% With consistently defined measurement locations with comparable occupancy, the actively-cooled building (AB) exhibits average $CO_2$ levels roughly 200 ppm higher than those observed in Kowloon City (KL) and Kwun Chong (KC); in contrast, the variation between measurement rounds within each building remains modest—typically under 100 ppm.
  
% Compared to these results, however, an interesting shift emerges in $CO_2$ levels across locations when examining concentrations near air vents—specifically, directly under diffusers or mechanical fans. This separation becomes a lot much less pronounced when we measured locations right underneath the fan compared to being much more pronounced for furtherest-point-aionway from ventilation as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:$CO_2$-spatial-loc1}.

%     \begin{figure}[h!]

%         \label{fig:$CO_2$-spatial-two}
%     \end{figure}
 

% \subsubsection{$CO_2$ levels as indicator of air quality}
% Ultimately, we wanted to assess whether $CO_2$ might serve a an indicator for ventilation efficiency, as preiovus studies have outlined. To achieve this, we compared the $CO_2$ levels across different locations we measured and create Figure~\ref{fig:$CO_2$-span-locs}. 

% \begin{figure}
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{img/$CO_2$_air_3.png}
%     \caption{$CO_2$ concentration mapped against air velocity from all three CFCs inside MSB Buildings(AB, KC, KL).}
%     \label{fig:$CO_2$-span-locs}
% \end{figure}

% Examining the color distribution in Figure~\ref{fig:$CO_2$-span-locs} reveals a clear contrast between the Building AB and its counter parties, KL and KC. AB consistently experiences lower air velocity, as indicated by the predominance of cooler colors (blue to light green) in the air velocity spectrum, paired with higher $CO_2$ levels  (warmer colors in the $CO_2$ range). This combination suggests that the retrofit introducing centralized air conditioning in AB has inadvertently led to stagnant airflow, allowing $CO_2$ to accumulate in confined zones. To zoom further into a single building we plotted out measurements from Kowloon City which has a very populated canteen area at building core that we measured as a scattered plot in Figure~\ref{fig:$CO_2$_airvel}. For Figure~\ref{fig:$CO_2$_airvel}, blue markers indicate measurements from mixed-mode ventilated systems (MMV), while black markers represent those from actively cooled systems (ACS). Here the red markers explicitly highlight the insufficient ventilation from the mix-mode ventilation in addressing a fully-loaded food service area at its service peak, underscoring the importance of more sufficient ventilation strategy even for mix-mode ventilation. 

% \begin{figure}[h!]
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{img/air_$CO_2$.png}
%     \caption{Scatterplot of $CO_2$ versus air velocity measured at KC across all measurement sessions. Marker colors indicate system type, with blue markers representing mixed-mode ventilation and black markers representing active cooling systems.}
%     \label{fig:$CO_2$_airvel}
% \end{figure}

% In contrast, KL and KC show a broader range of air velocities, with warmer air velocity colors (yellow to orange) appearing more frequently, reflecting more dynamic airflow. This corresponds to consistently lower $CO_2$ levels  (closer to baseline values of 400 ppm), suggesting that mixed ventilation systems promote better air exchange. The higher air velocities in KL and KC help disperse $CO_2$ concentrations, preventing the localized buildup seen in AB.

% \subsubsection{Statistical Analysis of $CO_2$ as a system evaluation tool}
%     We also ran a series of statistical tests on how $CO_2$ as an environmental condition compares to other iEQ metrics when buildings are of different system types. While we can qualitatively observe differences in $CO_2$ levels across measured locations, a quantitative assessment is still needed to evaluate how $CO_2$ compares to other key iEQ metrics as a diagnostic tool for identifying potential ventilation inadequacies in buildings. We therefore went ahead and conducted one-way ANOVA for each of these key metric with system type as the grouping variable and obtained Table~\ref{tab:anova_results}.  

%     All ANOVA results in the table indicate that system type is a highly significant factor for all the indoor environmental metrics, but the effect is especially pronounced for $CO_2$ and $T_a$. For example, the $CO_2$ ANOVA shows an F value of approximately 7419 with a p-value of 0.0, indicating that the differences in $CO_2$ concentrations between system types are extremely significant. Similarly the same could be said for air temperature ($T_a$) where the F value is slightly lower, as well as PM2.5, relative humidity(RH) and air velocity ($v_a$), F-value for $CO_2$ remains the largest. The exceptionally high F-value for $CO_2$ stresses its sensitivity to changes in ventilation performance between actively-cooled and mixed-mode systems. This finding suggests that elevated $CO_2$ levels can serve as a robust diagnostic marker, enabling designers and policymakers to identify retrofit strategies that inadvertently compromise natural ventilation. In turn, such diagnostics can inform the development of hybrid ventilation solutions that better balance energy efficiency, occupant comfort, and air quality—an essential consideration for sustainable urban retrofitting.

%     This suggest that $CO_2$ concentration is particularly sensitive to changes in the system type (i.e. whether the building is retrofitted with active cooilng versus mixed ventilation), and thus may serve a more discriminating metric in evaluating the performance and design trade-offs these retrofits compared to other parameters.  Essentially, while all environmental metrics show significant differences between the two system types, the very high F value for $CO_2$ supports its use as a key diagnostic tool in our study. In the meantime, we could see how when leveraged to qualitatively see the results in Figure~\ref{fig:$CO_2$seploc} where the retrofitted market consistently saw a higher levels of $CO_2$ across various locations it was measuring much more comparable to what was seen in actively cooled buildings compared to mixed-mode ventilated markets across various locations that were measured. Although PM2.5, air temperature, and relative humidity also vary between systems, our statistical analysis reveals that $CO_2$ exhibits the highest sensitivity to changes in ventilation performance. This reinforces the utility of $CO_2$ as a diagnostic metric, offering a straightforward means to quantify the hidden costs of retrofitting in terms of ventilation inefficiency.

% Connecting what we observed in Figure~\ref{fig:$CO_2$_airvel} and Figure~\ref{fig:PMVals}, our analysis revealed a surprising disconnect between $CO_2$ levels and PM2.5 values across both mixed-mode ventilated and actively cooled buildings. Although one might expect a strong correlation between these two parameters, our measurements points to the possibility that they are largely independent of each other. In densely populated areas, MMV systems maintained low $CO_2$ levels despite high PM2.5 concentrations, indicating that these systems can effectively mitigate indoor air pollution through ventilation. In contrast, ACS systems exhibited elevated $CO_2$ levels in conjunction with moderate PM2.5 values, highlighting the limitations of these systems in addressing both pollutants.

% This disconnect is significant, as it suggests that strategies aimed at reducing one pollutant (e.g., $CO_2$) may not necessarily impact the other (e.g., PM2.5). As such, our findings underscore the importance of considering both parameters when designing for indoor air quality. By understanding the separate relationships between $CO_2$ levels and air velocity, as well as PM2.5 values and air velocity, we can better inform the design of effective ventilation systems that address multiple pollutants simultaneously. For instance, incorporating hybrid ventilation systems that combine natural airflow with targeted mechanical assistance, or employing passive measures such as strategically placed solar shading and adjustable diffusers, may help mitigate the energy penalties associated with fully sealed retrofits.


% These findings highlight the trade-off associated with retrofitting AB with active cooling: while thermal comfort is enhanced, insufficient airflow compromises indoor air quality. Future retrofit strategies should prioritize improving airflow dynamics, particularly in air-conditioned environments, to mitigate stagnation and prevent elevated $CO_2$ levels. Implementing hybrid solutions—such as adjustable fans or strategically positioned diffusers—could optimize air movement and pollutant dispersion without sacrificing cooling efficiency. Furthermore, these results underscore the utility of $CO_2$ monitoring as a diagnostic tool, not only for assessing retrofit design performance but also for guiding retrofit interventions in urban settings where preserving natural ventilation remains critical.

\section{Discussions}
\subsection{Ventilation and Indoor Air Quality}
Our results showed significant differences in ventilation effectiveness and indoor air quality between actively cooled and mixed-mode ventilated Municipal Service Buildings (MSBs). The consistently elevated $CO_2$ concentrations observed in Aberdeen’s retrofitted building suggest a clear reduction in ventilation efficiency, attributable to the sealing of previously semi-open facades. Specifically, the observed mean increase in $CO_2$ concentrations (~216 ppm higher than mixed-mode counterparts) underscores a critical trade-off associated with modern retrofit strategies that prioritize thermal control over natural ventilation.

Furthermore, the lower air velocities measured within actively cooled environments, particularly Aberdeen, further support the notion that sealing building envelopes hampers natural air circulation, reducing the dilution of indoor contaminants and occupant-generated $CO_2$. The combined effect of elevated $CO_2$ and reduced air velocities points towards compromised indoor air quality and potential implications for occupant comfort and health. In contrast, the mixed-mode ventilated MSBs (Kowloon City and Kwun Chong) demonstrated significantly better ventilation performance, characterized by lower $CO_2$ concentrations and higher, more variable air velocities, which are indicative of improved air exchange and dilution of indoor pollutants.

The particulate matter (PM2.5) data further reinforces these observations. Actively cooled systems exhibited elevated and more variable particulate concentrations at lower air velocities, suggesting limited effectiveness in filtering or removing indoor pollutants when natural airflow is restricted. Mixed-mode systems, conversely, maintained lower particulate concentrations alongside higher air velocities, illustrating the inherent advantage of hybrid ventilation approaches in promoting healthier indoor air quality. These findings collectively underscore the necessity of reevaluating fully enclosed retrofit strategies for traditionally semi-open municipal buildings, advocating instead for tailored, hybrid solutions that integrate controlled natural ventilation alongside targeted active systems to better balance indoor air quality, occupant comfort, and energy efficiency.

Our decision to prioritize $CO_2$ as the diagnostic indicator of ventilation effectiveness is supported both conceptually and empirically. Unlike PM2.5 or VOC concentrations, which are influenced by localized activities, external pollutants, and filtration strategies, $CO_2$ provides a more stable and direct signal of occupancy-driven air quality and ventilation performance. This is reinforced by our comparative analysis: $CO_2$ exhibited the strongest and most consistent inverse relationship with air velocity among all measured parameters ($R^2$ $\approx$ 0.094), substantially exceeding the explanatory power of other metrics. This suggests that $CO_2$ not only reflects the dilution of exhaled air but also reliably captures the cumulative impact of enclosure and airflow reduction—central to understanding the consequences of retrofit strategies that diminish natural ventilation.
\subsection{Thermal Comfort Implications}
The thermal comfort indices calculated in this study (PMV, PPD, and PET) reveal important insights regarding the occupant experience in retrofitted versus mixed-mode ventilated Municipal Service Buildings (MSBs). While active cooling systems have been widely adopted under the assumption of improved occupant comfort, our findings indicate a nuanced outcome. Specifically, the retrofitted Aberdeen building, despite achieving lower indoor air temperatures, frequently registered PMV values beyond the recommended comfort range (±0.5), signifying that occupants experience conditions perceived as either excessively cool or uncomfortable.

The elevated PPD values in Aberdeen further support this observation, consistently exceeding the recommended dissatisfaction threshold of 10\%. This indicates that despite the introduction of active cooling intended to enhance thermal comfort, a substantial proportion of occupants may remain dissatisfied. This dissatisfaction likely arises from issues such as excessive cooling or inappropriate humidity management, both characteristic outcomes associated with sealing previously semi-open environments and relying solely on mechanical conditioning.

Furthermore, the Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) results corroborate these concerns. Aberdeen frequently exhibited PET values below recommended comfort thresholds (26–28$\degree C$), suggesting a tendency towards overcooling, which contrasts sharply with mixed-mode buildings like Kowloon City and Kwun Chong. The elevated thermal stress levels in Kowloon City and Kwun Chong, indicated by higher wet bulb temperatures, present a contrasting scenario in which insufficient active cooling or limited airflow management results in uncomfortable conditions.

Taken together, these findings highlight that fully sealed retrofit strategies, while achieving lower air temperatures, do not necessarily translate into improved occupant comfort. Instead, they may inadvertently produce environments perceived as excessively cool or inadequately balanced regarding humidity and airflow. This underscores the importance of adopting context-specific retrofit strategies, such as hybrid ventilation systems, that maintain natural airflow and provide more precise thermal regulation, ultimately enhancing occupant comfort while avoiding unnecessary energy expenditure.

\subsection{Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation of Cooling Loads}\label{seg:energy}

It is important to note that the following calculations are back-of-the-envelope estimations based on simplified, static rules using standard HVAC equations. These estimates are intended solely as a diagnostic tool to provide an order-of-magnitude understanding of additional cooling loads. They do not incorporate transient effects or detailed dynamic simulations that a full computational model would address. Nonetheless, to quantify the additional energy required by a retrofit that converts a semi-open, naturally ventilated Cooked Food Center (CFC) into a fully sealed, actively cooled environment, we estimate both the sensible and latent cooling loads. We assume that the retrofitted system is designed to meet a minimum ventilation requirement of $ACH$ (air changes per hour) as prescribed by local regulations.

For a given CFC with floor area $A$ (in m$^2$) and an assumed ceiling height $h$ (in m), the building volume is
\[
V = A \times h.
\]
The required ventilation flow rate $Q$ (in m$^3$/s) is then given by
\[
Q = \frac{ACH \times V}{3600}.
\]
Multiplying by air density $\rho$ (approximately 1.2 kg/m$^3$) yields the mass flow rate:
\[
\dot{m} = \rho\, Q.
\]

The sensible cooling load $Q_{\text{sens}}$ (in watts) is calculated as
\[
Q_{\text{sens}} = \dot{m}\, c_p\, \Delta T,
\]
where $c_p$ is the specific heat capacity of air (approximately 1.005 kJ/(kg$\cdot$K)) and $\Delta T = T_{\text{out}} - T_{\text{set}}$ is the temperature difference between the outdoor air temperature $T_{\text{out}}$ and the target indoor temperature $T_{\text{set}}$ (assumed to be 24$^\circ$C).

The latent cooling load $Q_{\text{lat}}$ is estimated by
\[
Q_{\text{lat}} = \dot{m}\, h_{fg}\, \Delta \omega,
\]
where $h_{fg}$ (approximately 2500 kJ/kg) is the latent heat of vaporization and $\Delta \omega$ is the difference in humidity ratio between the outdoor and desired indoor conditions. In our calculations, we assume $\Delta \omega$ to range from 0.005 to 0.010 kg water/kg air following ASHRAE Standard 62.1's specification on ventilation‑load calculation procedure\cite{ashrae2022}.

Thus, the total additional cooling load is
\[
Q_{\text{total}} = Q_{\text{sens}} + Q_{\text{lat}}.
\]

For our estimates, we assume a uniform ceiling height $h = 3$ m and $ACH = 6$. The floor areas for the three CFCs are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Aberdeen}: $A = 1288$ m$^2$
    \item \textbf{Kowloon City}: $A = 340$ m$^2$
    \item \textbf{Kwun Chong}: $A = 3260$ m$^2$
\end{itemize}

By substituting these values into the above equations and applying a range for $\Delta T$ (e.g., 4--8 K) and $\Delta \omega$ (0.005--0.010 kg/kg), we obtain the results summarized in Table~\ref{tab:cooling_loads}. These order-of-magnitude estimates illustrate the energy trade-offs inherent in retrofitting.

The cooling load estimations presented here allows us to highlight the critical energy implications associated with retrofitting semi-open municipal buildings into fully sealed, actively cooled environments. Our simplified analysis demonstrates that converting naturally ventilated Cooked Food Centers (CFCs) into enclosed spaces significantly increases both sensible and latent cooling loads, resulting in substantial additional energy demands. For example, Aberdeen's retrofitted CFC, with an estimated additional cooling load ranging from approximately 128 to 255 kW, illustrates a clear and quantifiable energy penalty that directly results from eliminating natural ventilation pathways.

Such elevated energy demands stem primarily from the increased requirement to mechanically condition air previously moderated through passive means. Specifically, latent cooling loads (97–193 kW for Aberdeen alone) emphasize that controlling humidity in sealed spaces requires substantial energy expenditure, often underappreciated in traditional retrofit planning. Given Hong Kong’s subtropical climate, characterized by high humidity levels, these latent loads become especially pronounced, driving up operational costs and environmental footprints.

The broader implication of these findings is profound: while retrofit initiatives are driven by legitimate intentions to modernize municipal buildings and enhance comfort, they must be evaluated against the steep energy costs they introduce. Our findings strongly suggest that retrofits prioritizing fully enclosed active cooling may not represent sustainable long-term solutions. Instead, tailored hybrid approaches, balancing controlled natural ventilation and selective mechanical conditioning, may significantly reduce cooling energy demands while preserving occupant comfort and indoor air quality. Consequently, policymakers and building managers should critically evaluate retrofit strategies, considering the nuanced interplay between ventilation, comfort, and energy efficiency clearly highlighted by this analysis.




\subsection{Recommended Retrofit Strategies}
Given the ventilation, comfort, and energy implications identified in this study, we recommend a shift toward more context-sensitive retrofit strategies for Municipal Service Buildings (MSBs), particularly for semi-open environments such as Cooked Food Centers (CFCs). The significant rise in $CO_2$ levels and diminished occupant comfort associated with fully sealed retrofits underscores the need to reconsider overly centralized, active cooling solutions. Instead, hybrid ventilation systems that combine targeted mechanical ventilation with controlled natural airflow should be explored, leveraging passive ventilation whenever outdoor conditions permit.

To effectively implement such strategies, retrofit designs should prioritize maintaining semi-open configurations or integrating adaptable façade elements—such as operable windows or dynamic louvers—that enable buildings to flexibly switch between passive and active ventilation modes. Additionally, localized active cooling or dehumidification units, strategically placed in areas with higher occupant density or heat stress (e.g., cooking or serving zones), could reduce overall energy demands compared to fully enclosed central systems. The targeted use of high-performance, low-cost environmental sensors, as demonstrated in this study, is recommended to continuously monitor indoor environmental quality, thus enabling responsive adjustments and improving long-term comfort and energy outcomes.

Finally, policymakers and building managers are encouraged to utilize $CO_2$ and thermal comfort indices regularly as diagnostic tools to evaluate retrofit effectiveness, ensuring interventions align with both occupant needs and sustainability objectives. Future retrofit policies and design guidelines should explicitly incorporate these nuanced considerations, balancing energy efficiency, thermal comfort, and ventilation performance to preserve the unique architectural and social qualities of municipal service buildings.

\section{Limitations and Future Work}

The limitations of this study include its reliance on short-term measurements to compare retrofitting outcomes, which precludes continuous evaluation of indoor environmental quality. It excludes detailed occupancy data under the assumption of similar temporal patterns across measured sites, potentially overlooking dynamic pollutant variations. The analysis prioritizes CO₂ concentration as a singular ventilation metric, sacrificing nuanced assessments from multi-parameter indices. Simplified energy calculations employ static assumptions (e.g., fixed ceiling heights, uniform outdoor conditions) to estimate cooling loads, limiting precision in quantifying retrofit trade-offs. Field experiments remain constrained by unavoidable variability in outdoor conditions and transient occupancy, despite efforts to standardize measurements and include control groups. Finally, findings are geographically limited to Municipal Service Buildings in Hong Kong, necessitating validation in broader architectural and climatic contexts.

Future work on retrofitting Municipal Service Buildings (MSBs) should prioritize developing retrofit solutions tailored to semi-open environments like Cooked Food Centers (CFCs). These spaces are inherently different from fully enclosed or temperature-controlled buildings, and their unique needs call for more adaptive strategies. For example, hybrid ventilation systems that combine natural airflow with targeted mechanical assistance could be explored to improve thermal comfort without compromising air exchange or energy efficiency\cite{39}. Such systems could offer a middle ground between active cooling and natural ventilation, addressing some of the limitations observed in this study.

Additionally, further research is needed to better quantify the trade-offs between indoor air quality, thermal comfort, and energy use in retrofitted CFCs\cite{40,41}. Long-term monitoring of retrofitted spaces, coupled with occupant feedback, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of how these environments perform over time. Expanding this research to include a wider variety of MSBs across different climates and urban contexts would also help establish generalizable guidelines for retrofitting these complex spaces. Incorporating new technologies, such as dynamic monitoring systems\cite{42} and data-driven design tools, could play a key role in achieving these goals. 


\section{Conclusions}

This study focuses on the the challenges and outcomes of retrofitting Cooked Food Centers (CFCs) within Municipal Service Buildings (MSBs) in Hong Kong, with a particular emphasis on the differences in indoor environmental quality and thermal comfort between actively-cooled(retrofitted) and mix-mode ventilated (non-retrofitted) CFCs. Our findings point to several important observations regarding the impact of transitioning from mixed ventilation systems to centralized air conditioning. Retrofitted CFCs, such as the Aberdeen CFC we examined, consistently showed higher $CO_2$ concentrations—often exceeding 650 ppm—alongside reduced ventilation performance. While active cooling systems lower indoor temperatures, they also introduce unintended consequences such as a decline in air exchange and potential thermal discomfort in certain zones. This raises critical questions about whether centralized cooling is the optimal retrofit strategy for spaces like wet markets, which have distinct ventilation and comfort requirements compared to conventional enclosed buildings.

In contrast, mixed-ventilation CFCs, such as those in Kowloon City and Kwun Chong, exhibited lower $CO_2$ levels and better overall ventilation. The natural attenuation of thermal stress observed in their reference buildings underscores the potential benefits of passive strategies, such as improved airflow and shading. These findings suggest that retrofit strategies for CFCs should be more nuanced and tailored to the semi-open, high-occupancy nature of these spaces, rather than defaulting to fully sealed, actively cooled solutions. Our results highlight that while active cooling can improve thermal comfort, it may compromise ventilation efficiency and drive up energy consumption. Therefore, thoughtful modernization should aim to balance these competing factors by adopting adaptive, context-specific retrofit solutions.

Our analysis further demonstrates that $CO_2$ concentrations can serve as a useful indicator for assessing ventilation performance, offering practical guidance for monitoring indoor air quality in complex environments. Although trade-offs between thermal comfort and energy use in retrofitted buildings have been well documented, our study reveals that the energy cost associated with reduced natural ventilation—quantified here through elevated $CO_2$ levels—may be a previously underappreciated penalty. Our back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that retrofitting a semi-open CFC into a fully sealed, actively cooled environment results in substantial increases in both sensible and latent cooling loads. This energy penalty not only raises operational costs but may also hinder progress toward sustainable building practices in high-density urban settings. Thus, our diagnostic approach, which leverages $CO_2$ measurements to capture ventilation inefficiencies, provides a critical quantitative metric that complements conventional energy and thermal comfort evaluations and underscores the need for more nuanced retrofit strategies.

In summary, our findings emphasize the necessity for thoughtful retrofit strategies that address the specific challenges of semi-open markets without compromising air quality, comfort, or energy efficiency. While retrofits are necessary for aging MSBs, no single solution fits all scenarios. Future efforts should focus on balancing the functional and environmental requirements of these unique spaces, while further refining diagnostic tools and energy models to better inform sustainable design practices.
