The sensing of $CO_2$, in the meantime, saw itself developing much further from expensive and slow-responding and expensive NDIR (non-dispersive infrared) "photometric" sensors to cheaper alternatives that are photoacoustic. Not only has these new alternatives pushed the price down to monitor $CO_2$ levels, the settling time has also drastically decreased from several days \cite{emmerich2005} to tens of minutes \cite{fisk2008} to as fast as 1min only\cite{sensirion2021,sensirion_scd4x_nodate}. Comparing the two technology, NDIR sensors typically settle faster since the measurement of $CO_2$ is in open-air optical path rather than relying on gas diffusion into a sealed chamber. Nonetheless, for low-cost sensors, low-cost variants like SCD41 (as this study deploys) has high accuracy within 400-5000 PPM for $CO_2$, is compliant with California Title24, RESET and WELL standards for buildings\cite{senseair2020,sensirion2021}. With its compatibility to common IAQ/building standards, we selectedc the SCD41 sensor due to its lower cost (well below 50 USD when purchased in bulk), reasonable response time and compact form factor to work with the developer boards.
