This study systematically evaluates and applies ML algorithms for predicting thermal comfort parameters, emphasizing data imputation, parameter-specific behaviour analysis, and the development of an Independent Parameterised Modelling Ensemble (IPME) framework. A data-driven approach addresses missing values in the ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II using ML algorithms tailored to each thermal comfort (TC) parameter. Performance metrics, such as coefficient of determination (R2) for numerical data and accuracy for categorical data, guide the selection process, resulting in optimised ML-TC pairs for imputation. The analysis reveals parameter-specific behaviours, with numerical parameters exhibiting varying correlations with environmental conditions and parameters related to individual preferences posing challenges. ML models show improved performance with categorical data, potentially because of their ability to capture subjective aspects effectively. The IPME framework was proposed to address the conventional ML limitations by employing a hybrid ensemble strategy that selects tailored TC parameter-specific ML algorithms. This approach aims to enhance prediction accuracy by acknowledging the uniqueness of parameters and harnessing diverse ML capabilities. Future research directions include further exploration of the IPME framework and post-imputation retraining of ML models to capture actual behaviour. This study underscores the potential of ML in enhancing thermal comfort analysis, offering insights into imputation strategies, parameter-specific behaviours, and ensemble modelling approaches for more reliable predictions in building environments.},

	abstract = {We analyzed the ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II to answer a fundamental but overlooked question in thermal comfort studies: how many and which subjective metrics should be used for the assessment of the occupants' thermal experience. We found that the thermal sensation is the most frequently used metrics in Thermal Comfort Database II, followed by thermal preference, comfort and acceptability. The thermal sensation/thermal preference, thermal comfort/air movement acceptability and thermal comfort/thermal preference are the top three most dependent metrics pairs. A principal component analysis confirmed that the personal experience of thermal conditions in built environment is not a one-dimensional problem, but at least a two-dimensional problem, and suggested thermal sensation and thermal comfort should be asked in right-now surveys as the first two Principal Component are majorly constructed by thermal sensation and thermal comfort. To further confirm the predictive power of thermal sensation and comfort, we used logistic regression and support vector machine to predict thermal acceptability and thermal preference with thermal sensation and comfort. The prediction accuracy is 87\% for thermal acceptability and 64\% for thermal preference. The prediction error might be due to occupants' individual difference and people errors in answering survey. These findings could help the design of chamber experiments, field studies, and human-building interaction interfaces by shedding light on the choice of subjective thermal metrics to effectively and accurately collect information on occupants’ thermal experience.},

	abstract = {Predicting building occupants’ thermal comfort via machine learning (ML) is a hot research topic. Many algorithms and data processing methods have been applied to predict thermal comfort indices in different contexts. But few studies have systematically investigated how different algorithms and data processing methods can inﬂuence the prediction accuracy. In this study, we ﬁrst summarized the recent literature from perspectives of predicted comfort indices, algorithms applied, input features, data sources, sample size, training proportion, predicting accuracy, etc. Then, we applied nine ML algorithms and three data sampling methods to predict the 3-point and 7-point thermal sensation vote (TSV) in ASHRAE Comfort Database II. The results show that with an accuracy of 66.3\% and 61.1\% for 3-point and 7-point TSV respectively, Random Forest (RF) has the best performance among the tested algorithms. Compared to the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) model, ML TSV models generally have higher accuracy in TSV prediction. Based on feature importance analysis, the air temperature, humidity, clothing, air velocity, age, and metabolic rate are the top six important features for TSV prediction. The RF algorithm can achieve 63.6\% overall accuracy in TSV prediction with the top three features, which is only 2.6\% lower than involving 12 input features. Further, this paper addressed other common considerations in ML comfort model establishment such as tuning hyperparameters, splitting of training and testing data, and encoding methods. We also provided Python and R programming codes and packages as appendixes, which can be a good reference for future studies.},

Although advances in the field of personal thermal comfort models are undeniable, there is still a lack of thorough and critical reviews of the current state of research in this field, especially considering the details of the predictive modeling process involved. This study has systematically reviewed 37 papers from over 100 academic publications on personal comfort models from the last two decades, and examined: (1) the data collection approach and dataset size, (2) number and type of participants involved, (3) climate, seasons and type of building involved, (4) model input and output variables, (5) modeling algorithm used, (6) performance indicator used, and (7) model final application. The review has identified a lack of diversity in building types, climates zones, seasons and participants involved in developing personal comfort models. It has also highlighted a lack of a unified and systematic framework for modeling development and evaluation, which currently hinders comparisons between studies. With most of the studies using machine learning techniques, the review has pointed to the challenges of “black box” models in the field. Finally, the review has indicated that personal input features using physiological sensing technologies can be further explored, especially considering the rapid advances seen today in wearable sensor technologies.},

	abstract = {A classroom thermal environment quality has an important role in a student’s life as it inﬂuences student’s performance and well-being. It is well known that at each educational stage, curricula demands different activities, different learning approaches and systematic thinking, requiring increasing levels of concentration. With increasing awareness about energy eﬃciency in buildings and indoor environment quality, somehow more emphasis is being given to energy eﬃciency. The absence of any standard or reference document relating to the design appropriate classrooms based on educational stages is worsening the situation. In this context, present study is done to ﬁnd out the progress in classrooms based thermal comfort studies over last ﬁfty years. Total 93 research articles selected from Scopus database were considered for this study. It was found that at each educational stage in the studied schools, students were highly unsatisﬁed with the prevailing indoor thermal environment and preferred cooler temperature than the existing indoor thermal environment. Primary school students were least sensitive to outdoor temperature changes. There are relatively few published articles published on thermal comfort in classrooms. Based on reported ﬁndings, no consistent temperature change was found necessary to record a shift of one thermal sensation vote by students at different educational stages in classroom. Identical behaviour was observed for classrooms operated under different operation modes. Moreover this study provides robust evidence that there is a need for separate set of different guidelines or standards for students of different ages in different stages of their education. This study also proposed adaptive comfort equations to estimate the indoor comfort temperature in classrooms at different educational stages.},

Moreover, the potential influence of spatiotemporal heterogeneity on health studies was explored. A breakpoint was found at approximately 11.5 ◦C in the segmented regression of indoor and outdoor temperature, and the slope of the curve was greater when outdoor temperature was above the breakpoint (n = 67,896). Based on multi-group propensity score matching (PSM) and generalized additive models (GAM), spatiotemporal heterogeneity was found in the relationship between indoor and outdoor temperatures after adjusting for building type and year. Furthermore, the relationship between indoor temperature and thermal sensation was influenced by the outdoor temperature. This study highlights the importance of considering indoor temperature or individual thermal exposure in temperature-related health studies.},
