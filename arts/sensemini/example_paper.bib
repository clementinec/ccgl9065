	abstract = {The predicted mean vote (PMV) and predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) are the most widely used thermal comfort indices. Yet, their performance remains a contested topic. The ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II, the largest of its kind, was used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the PMV/PPD model. We focused on: (i) the accuracy of PMV in predicting both observed thermal sensation (OTS) or observed mean vote (OMV) and (ii) comparing the PMV-PPD relationship with binned OTS – observed percentage of unacceptability (OPU). The accuracy of PMV in predicting OTS was only 34\%, meaning that the thermal sensation is incorrectly predicted two out of three times. PMV had a mean absolute error of one unit on the thermal sensation scale and its accuracy decreased towards the ends of the thermal sensation scale. The accuracy of PMV was similarly low for air-conditioned, naturally ventilated and mixed-mode buildings. In addition, the PPD was not able to predict the dissatisfaction rate. If the PMV model would perfectly predict thermal sensation, then PPD accuracy is higher close to neutrality but it would overestimate dissatisfaction by approximately 15–25\% outside of it. Furthermore, PMV-PPD accuracy varied strongly between ventilation strategies, building types and climate groups. These findings demonstrate the low prediction accuracy of the PMV–PPD model, indicating the need to develop high prediction accuracy thermal comfort models. For demonstration, we developed a simple thermal prediction model just based on air temperature and its accuracy, for this database, was higher than PMV.},

This research provides a comprehensive overview of data-driven approaches and processes for predicting personal thermal comfort in a building environment, as derived from a systematic review of 25 studies published in the last 10 years. After refining the concept of personal thermal comfort inspired by predictive modeling in personalized medicine and healthcare, the selection criteria were identified for the reviewed research. Then, three key elements affecting the data-driven modeling process were focused and reviewed, including experimental design, data collection, and modeling techniques. A special emphasis was placed on modeling techniques across the selected studies through a categorization process and comparison of their prediction accuracies. Feature selection and issues important for particular personal thermal comfort models were also reviewed and summarized. Upon reviewing these studies, the authors also considered inter- and intra-individual variability issues in sampling and modeling, data quantity and quality resulting from the collection procedure, model performance, feature importance, and implications for potential online learning techniques. Throughout these analyses, limitations of the current state-of-the-art and possible avenues for future study were addressed.},

Reviewed studies were investigated to highlight ML applications, parameters, methods, performance and challenges. The results show that 62\% of reviewed studies focused on developing group-based comfort models, while 35\% focused on personal comfort models (PCMs) which account for individual differences and present high prediction accuracy. ML models could outperform PMV and adaptive models with up to 35.9\% and 31\% higher accuracy and PCMs could outperform PMV models with up to 74\% higher accuracy. Applying ML-based control schemas reduced thermal comfort-related energy consumption in buildings up to 58.5\%, while improving indoor quality up to 90\% and reducing CO2 levels up to 24\%. Using physiological parameters improved the prediction accuracy of PCMs up to 97\%. Future studies are recommended to further investigate PCMs, determine the optimum sample size and consider both fitting and error metrics for model evaluation. This study introduces data collection, thermal comfort indices, time scale, sample size, feature selection, model selection, and real world application as the remaining challenges in the application of ML in thermal comfort studies.},

	abstract = {Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems in large-scale buildings often struggle to ensure satisfactory thermal comfort for diverse occupants while minimizing energy waste. Achieving this goal requires developing reliable prediction models that capture the changing and varied occupant thermal perceptions in different spaces. Despite their widespread use, many machine learning (ML) based prediction models suffer from subjective data biases and model predictive uncertainties, causing inaccurate estimation for occupant needs and leading to suboptimal building controls. The authors propose a data-model integration method that identifies and calibrates the inherent uncertainties of existing ML models in both data and model dimensions, ensuring reliable thermal perception predictions. This method introduces the Multidimensional Association Rule Mining (M-ARM) algorithm to identify biased human responses by exploring interrelationships among four perception metrics: thermal sensation, comfort, acceptability, and preference. Our method reveals significant performance enhancements in seven ML models, enhancing the F1-score by up to 5.53\%. By leveraging reliability diagrams and Expected Calibration Error (ECE) scores, we also expose the models’ vulnerability to miscalibration and the need for calibrated predictions. We further evaluate six calibration techniques (e.g., Platt Scaling and Isotonic Calibration) on these models and uncover their potential to enhance prediction reliability performance, highlighting a reduction of up to 80.66\% in ECE scores. The authors also investigated the impacts of dataset sizes, classifiers, and calibration methods on the proposed method. Our research offers insight into creating robust data-driven strategies for thermal perception predictions, ultimately contributing to optimized occupant comfort and energy efficiency in buildings.},

	abstract = {The perception, physiology, behavior, and performance of building occupants are influenced by multi-domain exposures: the simultaneous presence of multiple environmental stimuli, i.e., visual, thermal, acoustic, and air quality. Despite being extensive, the literature on multi-domain exposures presents heterogeneous methodological approaches and inconsistent study reporting, which hinder direct comparison between studies and metaanalyses. Therefore, in addition to carrying out more multi-domain studies, such investigations need to be designed, conducted, and documented in a systematic and transparent way. With the goal to facilitate and support future multi-domain studies and their meta-analyses, this work provides (1) a range of criteria for multidomain study design and reporting (i.e., defined as quality criteria), and (2) a critical review of the multi-domain literature based on the described criteria, which can serve as guidelines and recommendations for future studies on the topic. The identified quality criteria encompass study set-up, study deployment and analysis, and study outcome, stressing the importance of adopting a consistent terminology and result reporting style. The developed critical review highlights several shortcomings in the design, deployment, and documentation of multi-domain studies, emphasizing the need for quality improvements of future multi-domain research. The ultimate goal of this work is to consolidate our knowledge on multi-domain exposures for its integration into regulatory resources and guidelines, which are currently dominated by single-domain knowledge.},

	abstract = {The predicted mean vote (PMV) and predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) are the most widely used thermal comfort indices. Yet, their performance remains a contested topic. The ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II, the largest of its kind, was used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the PMV/PPD model. We focused on: (i) the accuracy of PMV in predicting both observed thermal sensation (OTS) or observed mean vote (OMV) and (ii) comparing the PMV-PPD relationship with binned OTS – observed percentage of unacceptability (OPU). The accuracy of PMV in predicting OTS was only 34\%, meaning that the thermal sensation is incorrectly predicted two out of three times. PMV had a mean absolute error of one unit on the thermal sensation scale and its accuracy decreased towards the ends of the thermal sensation scale. The accuracy of PMV was similarly low for air-conditioned, naturally ventilated and mixed-mode buildings. In addition, the PPD was not able to predict the dissatisfaction rate. If the PMV model would perfectly predict thermal sensation, then PPD accuracy is higher close to neutrality but it would overestimate dissatisfaction by approximately 15–25\% outside of it. Furthermore, PMV-PPD accuracy varied strongly between ventilation strategies, building types and climate groups. These findings demonstrate the low prediction accuracy of the PMV–PPD model, indicating the need to develop high prediction accuracy thermal comfort models. For demonstration, we developed a simple thermal prediction model just based on air temperature and its accuracy, for this database, was higher than PMV.},

	abstract = {Heavy traffic flows commonly result in large vehicular pollutant exposure in near-road buildings. Street layouts and pollutant source settings are key factors. Advertisement boards are sometimes adopted for business purpose, but their impacts on pollutant dispersion and exposure are still unclear. Thus, this paper numerically investigates the influence of aspect ratios (building height/street width, H/Ws = 1 or 2; H = 30 m), source locations and advertisement-board settings on the flow, carbon monoxide (CO) dispersion and exposure within three-dimensional urban-like models under the parallel approaching wind to the main streets. Personal intake fraction (P\_iF) represents the fraction of total vehicular emissions inhaled averagely by each person of a population. Spatial mean P\_iF is named as {\textless}P\_iF{\textgreater} and that for the entire building as building intake fraction ({\textless}P\_iF{\textgreater}B). With span-wise CO source fixed in target secondary streets of No 2 or 13 (S2 or S13), {\textless}P\_iF{\textgreater} is particularly large in target streets. {\textless}P\_iF{\textgreater}B decreases exponentially toward downstream from the target street and S13 cases attain greater {\textless}P\_iF{\textgreater}B and larger exponential decreasing rates. Cases with H/Ws = 2 experiences more limited upward dispersion and subsequently smaller {\textless}P\_iF{\textgreater} (0.155–0.339 ppm) of entire target street than cases with H/Ws = 1 (0.375–0.731 ppm). For cases with stream-wise CO source along the main street (Smain), {\textless}P\_iF{\textgreater}B first rises quickly toward downstream, then adjusts to equilibrium values (0.051–0.063 ppm). Finally, with span-wise source, vertical and double-layer advertisement boards produce stronger upward CO transportation and greater {\textless}P\_iF{\textgreater}B than lateral and single-layer types, while with Smain source, the double-layer and lateral types produce larger {\textless}P\_iF{\textgreater}B and shorter exposure adjustment distance.},

In current study, the effect of daylight distribution in interior spaces on human thermal comfort conditions and energy consumption in the residential buildings is investigated based on light shelf using simulation methods and tools. Firstly, a comprehensive parametric study is presented to examine the impact of light shelf design parameters (including angle, depth and number of the light shelves) on two objective functions of building’s total energy consumption (including heating, cooling and electrical energy) and predicted percentage of dissatisﬁed people. Then, employing genetic algorithm, a multiobjective optimization is conducted in order to minimize the two objective functions simultaneously. Light shelves are evaluated for three orientations of West, South and East; horizontally and vertically. Results show that the optimum angle, depth and number of light shelves for West orientation are 24.37 , 0.571 m and 5, respectively; for South orientation are 89.62 , 0.295 m and 4, respectively; for East orientation are 36.51 , 0.659 m and 4, respectively. In addition, results indicate that optimum conditions of light shelves decreases the total heating, cooling and electrical energy consumption by 27.819 kWh/ m2, 49.176 kWh/m2 and 34.853 kWh/m2, respectively.},

	abstract = {The newly developed Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), along with the physiological equivalent temperature (PET), the humidex (HX) and the wind chill index (WC), was calculated in Quebec City, Canada, a city with a strong seasonal climatic variability, over a 1-year period. The objective of this study is twofold: evaluate the operational benefits of implementing the UTCI for a climate monitoring program of public comfort and health awareness as opposed to relying on traditional and simple indices, and determine whether thermal comfort monitoring specific to dense urban neighborhoods is necessary to adequately fulfill the goals of the program. In order to do so, an analysis is performed to evaluate each of these indices’ sensitivity to the meteorological variables that regulate them in different environments. Overall, the UTCI was found to be slightly more sensitive to mean radiant temperature, moderately more sensitive to humidity and much more sensitive to wind speed than the PET. This dynamic changed slightly depending on the environment and the season. In hot weather, the PET was found to be more sensitive to mean radiant temperature and therefore reached high values that could potentially be hazardous more frequently than the UTCI and the HX. In turn, the UTCI’s stronger sensitivity to wind speed makes it a superior index to identify potentially hazardous weather in winter compared to the PET and the WC. Adopting the UTCI broadly would be an improvement over the traditionally popular HX and WC indices. The urban environment produced favorable conditions to sustain heat stress conditions, where the indices reached high values more frequently there than in suburban locations, which advocates for weather monitoring specific to denser urban areas.},

	abstract = {There are interactive performances of climatic control within a car cabin in energy consumption, thermal comfort, and air quality. This paper presents sensitivity analysis of those performance indices coupled with mathematical models of air conditions within a car cabin. Through sensitivity analysis, controlled variables are identified for the most influence on energy consumption, thermal comfort, and air quality in effective climatic control. The performance indices are defined from energy consumption of air conditioning unit, predicted mean vote, and concentration of carbon dioxide while mathematical models of air conditions within a car cabin are developed to determine quantitative impact from controlled variables under given operating conditions. Good agreement of simulated results with experimental data is reported for model validation of a sedan car. Some conclusive comments in case studies are recommended from the proposed methodology. In parking, reducing windshield transmissivity by 5\% using cover decreases predicted mean vote index by 0.9\%. During driving, amount of supply air and temperature can be adjusted to improve thermal comfort whereas energy consumption increases. It is found that decreasing temperature by 5\% is superior since corresponding impact on energy consumption is less than increasing amount of supply air by 5\% while a predicted mean vote can be decreased by 20.4\%. On the other hands, increasing amount of supply air is the most effective way when thermal comfort and air quality are needed to be improved. Increasing amount of supply air by 5\% results in changes of the predicted mean vote index and concentration of carbon dioxide by -17.5\%, and -0.74\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {Operator decisions regarding daily and seasonal scheduling of systems’ availability and setpoints play an important role in building performance. This paper reviews the key operational parameters of 14 office buildings in Ottawa, Canada. The results revealed that over 60\% of the air handling units (AHUs) were not turned off outside of normal occupied hours, and most of them did not have an economizer cycle. The indoor temperature setpoints were between 20 and 24 °C. Based on these insights, a building performance simulation (BPS)-based sensitivity analysis was conducted to better understand the energy and comfort performance implications of common operator decisions. Eight operational parameters were studied: AHU start and stop times, seasonal switchover to heating and cooling times, heating and cooling season temperature setpoints, and ventilation rate and mode (i.e., constant or occupancy-based). The results revealed that the AHU start and stop times and the ventilation rate are the most critical operational parameters examined in terms of affecting the energy and comfort performance of the buildings investigated. Subsequently, a mixed-integer genetic algorithm was applied to identify the optimal operational parameters among the set of eight operational parameters investigated for four different heating dominated climate zones, nine different occupancy and three different envelope scenarios. The relationships between the variables of these scenarios and the optimal operational parameters were examined.},

Previous studies assessed both indoor thermal comfort and energy efficiency of a BIPV/T-DSF building through the use of the photovoltaic devices and ventilation types of the BIPV/T-DSF, however, which did not evaluate the effect of other dominant design parameters on the BIPV/T-DSF's performance. This paper presents a simulation study of sensitivity analysis on the correlations between indoor thermal comfort and energy consumption and various design parameters of the BIPV/T-DSF operating in different configurations and climatic conditions. The results showed that solar heat gain coefficient of the BIPV/T-DSF's external window possessed the highest importance affecting indoor thermal comfort and energy consumption, while thermal transmittance of both the internal and external windows and cavity depth of the BIPV/T-DSF showed also the notable importance to the building performances.},

	abstract = {Although local air movement acts as a critical factor to enhance human thermal comfort and energy efficiency, the various factors influencing such movement have led to inconsistent publications on how to evaluate and design localised airflow systems in practice. This study aims to identify the main impacting factors for a localised airflow system and predict a cooling performance based on machine learning algorithms. Three typical localised airflow forms, i.e. an isothermal air supply (IASN), non-isothermal air supply (NIASN), and floor fan (FF), were deployed. The experiments were conducted under a variety of temperature/humidity/local air velocity conditions in a well-controlled climate chamber, and a database including 1305 original samples was built. The primary results indicated that a classification tree C5.0 model showed a better prediction performance (83.99\%) for a localised airflow system, with 17 input parameters in the model. Through a sensitivity analysis, 8 feature variables were quantified as having significant main effect responses on subjects’ thermal sensation votes (TSV), and three environmental factors (temperature, air velocity, and relative humidity) were identified as having the most significant effects. Using the 8 sensitive factors, the C5.0 model was modified with 82.30\% accuracy for subject TSV prediction. A tree model demonstrating the decision rules in the C5.0 model was obtained, with air velocity (=0 m/s, {\textgreater}0 m/s) as the first feature variable and root node, and temperature (⩽28 °C, {\textgreater}28 °C) as the second feature variable and leaf node, respectively. The outcomes that provide the most influential variables and a machine learning model are beneficial for evaluating personal thermal comfort at individual levels and for guiding the application of a localised airflow system in buildings.},

In this sense, the present research intends to contribute to the implementation of the Passive House concept in Portugal, by means of a detailed study for the Aveiro region and a more broad analysis examination for different district capitals of Portugal mainland. A detached two-storey lightweight steel structure of contemporary architecture was modelled as case study for the Portuguese climate, based on its original design solutions and resorting to the EnergyPlus® software. From this original model, sensitivity analyses were carried out in order to meet the parameters defined by PH standards. The improved results from the climate region of Aveiro, in Portugal, have led to a reduction of the 62\%, 72\% and 4.4\% for the heating demand, cooling demand and overheating rate, respectively (comparing the improved solution with the original as reference). It was therefore possible to meet the PH requirements, proving its applicability to the Portuguese climate and for this particular building technology.},

	abstract = {In a traditional building design process (TDP), design variables are fixed sequentially, as opposed to integrated design process (IDP) which tends to avoid sequential design phases to create more sustainable buildings. First, a reference building is introduced and an energy model based on TRNSYS is presented to determine the energy consumption and comfort in the building. The model is validated based on energy bills, certified simulations and literature. Then, the paper performs an extended sensitivity analysis (SA) of 30 design variables with respect to different performance criteria related to energy consumption and comfort, based on a TRNSYS model. Three SA techniques were used, namely standard regression coefficients (SRC), partial rank correlation coefficients (PRCC) and Sobol indices. Results show that all three techniques yielded a similar ranking of the importance of the variables for most model outputs. Interactions between variables were identified with second-order Sobol indices. In the second part of this paper, a traditional design framework was adopted in which sets of variables were fixed sequentially. A SA was performed at each phase of the process, assuming fixed values for parameters chosen in previous design phases. Results show that fixing variables during the phases of a traditional design process tends to reduce the probabilities of finding low-energy consumption designs. Moreover, the influence of some variables was found to change during the design phases.},

	abstract = {Improving energy performance of buildings is one of the most important tasks for reaching sustainability. Assessing building energy consumption is performed more often with specialized simulation tools. Sensitivity analysis proved to be a valuable tool for creating more reliable and realistic building energy models and better buildings. This paper briefly describes the methodology for running global sensitivity analysis and tools that can be used, and presents the results of such an analysis conducted for winter period, daily, on input variables covering a real building's operation, control and occupant related parameters that affect both thermal comfort and heating energy consumption. Two sets of inputs were created. The only difference between these sets is an addition of clothing insulation and occupant heat gain as input variables. The reference building was simulated for three distinctive winter weeks. Two additional input variables have an effect especially on thermal comfort, but they do not disturb the relative order of other influential input variables. The common influential variables for both energy consumption and thermal comfort were identified and are: air handling unit sup-ply temperature and airflow rate and control system related parameters. This can help in future research into implementing the simulation-assisted optimized operation in real buildings.},

After refining the concept of personal thermal comfort inspired by predictive modeling in personalized medicine and healthcare, the selection criteria were identified for the reviewed research. Then, three key elements affecting the data-driven modeling process were focused and reviewed, including experimental design, data collection, and modeling techniques. A special emphasis was placed on modeling techniques across the selected studies through a categorization process and comparison of their prediction accuracies. Feature selection and issues important for particular personal thermal comfort models were also reviewed and summarized. Upon reviewing these studies, the authors also considered inter- and intra-individual variability issues in sampling and modeling, data quantity and quality resulting from the collection procedure, model performance, feature importance, and implications for potential online learning techniques. Throughout these analyses, limitations of the current state-of-the-art and possible avenues for future study were addressed.},

Despite being extensive, the literature on multi-domain exposures presents heterogeneous methodological approaches and inconsistent study reporting, which hinder direct comparison between studies and metaanalyses. Therefore, in addition to carrying out more multi-domain studies, such investigations need to be designed, conducted, and documented in a systematic and transparent way. With the goal to facilitate and support future multi-domain studies and their meta-analyses, this work provides (1) a range of criteria for multidomain study design and reporting (i.e., defined as quality criteria), and (2) a critical review of the multi-domain literature based on the described criteria, which can serve as guidelines and recommendations for future studies on the topic. The identified quality criteria encompass study set-up, study deployment and analysis, and study outcome, stressing the importance of adopting a consistent terminology and result reporting style. The developed critical review highlights several shortcomings in the design, deployment, and documentation of multi-domain studies, emphasizing the need for quality improvements of future multi-domain research. The ultimate goal of this work is to consolidate our knowledge on multi-domain exposures for its integration into regulatory resources and guidelines, which are currently dominated by single-domain knowledge.},

Our experiments show that HH-VAEM outperforms existing baselines in the tasks of missing data imputation and supervised learning with missing features.
