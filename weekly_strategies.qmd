## How to Use These
Each week, reveal one strategy at the **end of the activity** (3-5 min). The rhythm:

1. **Hook** — a grabby example
2. **The Science** — one paragraph, name the effect
3. **You Just Saw It** — connect to what happened in class
4. **Next Week's Challenge** — something to try

At the **start of the following week**, do a 1-min callback: "Last week's strategy was X — anyone try it?"

# Week 2: The Open Loop

## The Hook

::: {style="font-size: 1.8em; background: #2c3e50; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px; text-align: center;"}
In 1927, a psychologist noticed waiters could remember complex orders perfectly — until the bill was paid.

**Then they forgot everything instantly.**
:::

---

## The Science

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
This is the **Zeigarnik Effect**.

The brain can't let go of incomplete tasks. It allocates background processing — like a browser tab you can't close.

Netflix forces a 3-second hook before "Skip Intro" appears. Marketers call this an **open loop**: start a pattern, don't close it.

**The brain will stay to close the loop.**
:::

---

## You Just Saw It

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
The best presentations today didn't start with conclusions.

They started with a question. A tension. Something unresolved.

*"There's one fact that made me switch sides on this issue. I'll get to it."*

Did you stay to hear it? That's the loop.
:::

---

## Next Week's Challenge

::: {style="font-size: 2em; background: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px; text-align: center;"}
**Open a loop in your first 10 seconds.**

Don't close it until the end.
:::

---

# Week 3: The Barnum Slide

## The Hook

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; background: #2c3e50; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px;"}
*"You have a tendency to be critical of yourself. You have a great need for others to like you. You have considerable unused capacity that you haven't turned to your advantage."*

**85% of people rate this as "highly accurate" for them.**

It's the same text for everyone.
:::

---

## The Science

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
This is the **Barnum Effect** (Forer, 1949).

Statements that feel specific but apply to almost everyone create false intimacy. Horoscopes, psychics, personality tests — all exploit this.

The trick: **moderate specificity + universal anxiety**.

People remember the hits, forget the misses.
:::

---

## You Just Saw It

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
When a speaker said something like:

*"Some of you are thinking, 'This doesn't affect me.' But you're also wondering if you're doing enough..."*

Did it feel personal? It wasn't. It was statistical.

But it **worked**.
:::

---

## Next Week's Challenge

::: {style="font-size: 2em; background: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px; text-align: center;"}
**Write one sentence that sounds personal but applies to everyone in the room.**

Test it. Watch faces.
:::

---

# Week 4: Sensory Hijack

## The Hook

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; background: #2c3e50; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px;"}
People holding a **warm cup of coffee** rated strangers as more trustworthy than those holding iced drinks.

They had no idea the cup mattered.
:::

---

## The Science

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
This is **Embodied Cognition** (Williams & Bargh, 2008).

The body doesn't just receive information — it **shapes judgment**.

- Physical warmth → social warmth
- Heaviness → seriousness
- Roughness → difficulty

**The brain takes sensory shortcuts constantly.**
:::

---

## You Just Saw It

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
The arguments that landed today weren't abstract.

They made you **feel something in your body**.

Not "rising temperatures cause problems."

But: *"Your grandmother's lungs filling with smoke from a wildfire that didn't exist 20 years ago."*
:::

---

## Next Week's Challenge

::: {style="font-size: 2em; background: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px; text-align: center;"}
**Make your audience physically uncomfortable — on purpose.**

One image. One sentence. Body-first.
:::

---

# Week 5: The Anchoring Trap

## The Hook

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; background: #2c3e50; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px;"}
Realtors show you a terrible, overpriced house **first**.

The second house — still overpriced — looks reasonable.

**You don't evaluate houses. You evaluate differences from the anchor.**
:::

---

## The Science

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
This is **Anchoring** (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).

The first number you hear distorts all subsequent judgment — even when it's obviously irrelevant.

In experiments, people estimated higher values after spinning a **random wheel** with higher numbers.

**The brain cannot ignore the anchor.**
:::

---

## You Just Saw It

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
When someone opened with an extreme number:

*"AI could consume 30% of global electricity by 2040. Even the conservative estimate is 12%."*

Now 12% sounds reasonable. But 12% is still catastrophic.

**The anchor did its job.**
:::

---

## Next Week's Challenge

::: {style="font-size: 2em; background: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px; text-align: center;"}
**Lead with the extreme. Then offer the "reasonable" version.**

Set the anchor before they do.
:::

---

# Week 6: The Specificity Illusion

## The Hook

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; background: #2c3e50; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px;"}
Which is more believable?

A: *"The project will take a few weeks."*

B: *"The project will take 17 days."*

**B. Always B.** Even if both are equally made up.
:::

---

## The Science

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
This is the **Specificity Heuristic**.

The brain uses detail as a proxy for credibility. Specific = precise = probably measured = probably true.

Con artists and skilled liars know this: add irrelevant detail and people stop questioning.

*"I was at the corner of 5th and Main at 3:47pm"* beats *"I was downtown that afternoon."*
:::

---

## You Just Saw It

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
Arguments that landed today had **unnecessary precision**:

- Not "lots of energy" → "415 TWh"
- Not "many people" → "240 million people"
- Not "recently" → "March 2024"

The detail signals: *I didn't make this up.*
:::

---

## Next Week's Challenge

::: {style="font-size: 2em; background: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px; text-align: center;"}
**Replace every vague word with a specific number, date, or name.**

Even if no one checks — they'll believe you more.
:::

---

# Week 7: The Pre-Mortem

## The Hook

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; background: #2c3e50; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px;"}
The CIA developed a technique:

Before launching an operation, assume it **failed catastrophically**.

Then ask: *"What went wrong?"*

**Teams using pre-mortems catch 30% more risks.**
:::

---

## The Science

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
This is **Prospective Hindsight** (Mitchell et al., 1989).

Imagining failure as *already happened* unlocks different cognitive pathways than "what could go wrong?"

The brain is better at **explaining the past** than predicting the future.

So you trick it: treat the future as past.
:::

---

## You Just Saw It

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
The teams that did well today **anticipated the counterattack**.

They didn't ask "what might they say?"

They assumed: *"We lost. Why?"*

Then they fixed it before it happened.
:::

---

## Next Week's Challenge

::: {style="font-size: 2em; background: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px; text-align: center;"}
**Before you present, assume it bombed.**

Write three reasons why. Fix them.
:::

---

# Week 8: The Fork

## The Hook

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; background: #2c3e50; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px;"}
*"Are you going to let your family suffer, or are you going to act now?"*

The trick isn't the answer.

**The trick is that both options accept your frame.**
:::

---

## The Science

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
This is the **False Dilemma** — or in sales, **The Fork**.

Present two choices that both serve your goal.

*"Do you want the red one or the blue one?"*
(Not: "Do you want to buy a car?")

The brain loves binary choices. Multiple options = paralysis.

**Two options = decision.**
:::

---

## You Just Saw It

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
When someone said:

*"We can either regulate AI now, or let corporations decide for us."*

Notice what's missing?

**"Do nothing" wasn't an option.** Because they didn't put it there.
:::

---

## Next Week's Challenge

::: {style="font-size: 2em; background: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px; text-align: center;"}
**End with two options — both of which support your case.**

Remove the third option before they think of it.
:::

---

# Week 9: The Invisible Bandwagon

## The Hook

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; background: #2c3e50; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px;"}
Researchers changed one line in a tax notice:

*"9 out of 10 people in your area pay their taxes on time."*

**Compliance jumped 15%.**

Not moral appeal. Not threats. Just: *you're the weird one if you don't.*
:::

---

## The Science

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
This is **Social Proof** + **Normative Messaging**.

But the key is: **local and specific**.

- "Most people" → weak
- "Most people in your building" → strong
- "Most people in your building with kids your age" → irresistible

**The more similar the reference group, the more powerful the pull.**
:::

---

## You Just Saw It

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
The best arguments today didn't say "people care about climate."

They said:

*"Engineers at HKU are already shifting their research priorities."*

A bandwagon that didn't exist until you named it.
:::

---

## Next Week's Challenge

::: {style="font-size: 2em; background: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px; text-align: center;"}
**Create a bandwagon for your argument.**

Make it local. Make it specific. Make them the outlier if they disagree.
:::

---

# Week 10: The Cliffhanger Return

## The Hook

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; background: #2c3e50; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px;"}
Every TV episode ends mid-scene.

Not at resolution — at **maximum tension**.

*Breaking Bad* ended seasons on unresolved gunshots, half-spoken sentences.

**Because you will come back to close the loop.**
:::

---

## The Science

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
The **Zeigarnik Effect** again — now applied to structure.

But here's the twist: **anticipation is often more pleasurable than completion itself**.

Dopamine spikes in anticipation, not reward.

Open strong. Return at the end — **transformed**.
:::

---

## You Just Saw It

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
The presentations that stuck opened with an image or person.

Built the argument.

Then **returned** to that image at the close — but now you saw it differently.

*"Remember the farmer I mentioned? She's watching this debate. What do you want her to hear?"*
:::

---

## Next Week's Challenge

::: {style="font-size: 2em; background: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px; text-align: center;"}
**Your last line should echo your first — transformed.**

The bookend is the memory anchor.
:::

---

# Week 11: The Self-Persuasion Trick

## The Hook

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; background: #2c3e50; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px;"}
People paid **$1** to lie about a boring task later *believed the task was interesting*.

People paid **$20** didn't change their beliefs.

**Why?**
:::

---

## The Science

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
This is **Cognitive Dissonance** (Festinger, 1957).

$1 wasn't enough justification, so the brain invented one: *"I must have actually liked it."*

Cults don't brainwash. They get you to **do things**.

Then your brain rewrites the story.

**Behavior first. Belief follows.**
:::

---

## You Just Saw It

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
The most powerful moments today weren't when someone *told* you what to think.

They were when someone asked you to **do something**:

*"Raise your hand if you've ever felt hopeless about climate."*

Now you've publicly identified. Your brain needs to reconcile that.
:::

---

## The Final Challenge

::: {style="font-size: 2em; background: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px; text-align: center;"}
**Don't tell them the conclusion.**

Make them say it. Make them do something.

**They'll persuade themselves.**
:::
