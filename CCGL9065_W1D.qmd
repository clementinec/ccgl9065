# Welcome to <span style="color:red">**CCGL9065 Our Response to Climate Change: HK2100**</span>

---

## 1: **Why This Course?**

- Explore **climate change** as more than a scientific issue.
- Understand **why** climate action is deprioritized, debated, or ignored.
- Develop **skills to analyze narratives** and shape arguments for or against climate action.

---

## 2: Framing the Semester's Focus

**Big Question for This Course:**
- Why is climate change, a crisis backed by science, often ignored or deprioritized?

> *This semester is about exploring why science isn't enough—and how we structure and understand the narratives around climate action.*

---

## 3: Do <span style="color:red">YOU</span> Believe in Climate Change?

<!-- **Question 1:**  
- "Do you believe climate change is real?"  
    - Options: **Yes**, **No**, **Unsure**

**Question 2:**  
- "Do you believe humans are the primary cause of climate change?"  
    - Options: Strongly Agree / Agree / Neutral / Disagree / Strongly Disagree -->
- Do you think it's real?
- How urgent do you believe it is to act upon it?

::: {.notes}
- Use Mentimeter to collect responses.
- Move to the mentimeter page.
- Frame results neutrally, emphasizing the diversity of views.
:::

<!-- ---

## 4: Interactive Poll 2: Priority vs. Belief Mapping

**Poll Question:**  
"Where do you stand on this coordinate system?"  

- **X-axis**: "Climate Change is Real (True/False)"  
- **Y-axis**: "How Urgent is Action? (Low/High Priority)"

**Activity:**  
- Use a live polling tool to plot responses visually. -->

---

## 4: What do we make of the poll results?

**Discussion Questions:**  
1. "What do these results reveal about our class’s perspectives?"  
2. "Why do you think some people deprioritize climate action, even if they believe it is real?"  

---

## 5: Climate Change as A Scientific Fact
- **Evidence**:  
  - CO₂ levels > 420 ppm.  
  - Global temperature rise: **+1.2°C since pre-industrial times.**  
  - Impacts: sea-level rise, extreme weather, biodiversity loss, increasing wild fire.

::: {.notes}
- Co2 is a GHG that traps heat in the earth's atmosphere that amplifies the GH effect causing global warming.
- Most of human history median is 280ppm. CO2 has risen dramatically since industrial revolution (~1750) from burning fossil fuels, deforestation and industrial processes - highest in at least 800,000 years data from ice cores.
- It's current increasing by 2-3 PPM/year is unprecendented in earth's history outpacing natural changes that occurs over milennia.
- Challenge the students: Expand and check on the global temperature rise/impacts accordingly? 
:::

## 6: The Challenge – No Action

Despite overwhelming evidence...  

- Climate change is often **ignored or deprioritized**.  

---

### **Key Barriers to Action:**  
1. **Cognitive Dissonance**:  
   - Climate feels abstract or distant.  
2. **Competing Narratives**:  
   - Conflicts in media, politics, and corporate messaging.  
- Poll again?

::: {.notes}
- Emphasize the disconnect between scientific evidence and societal response.  
- Transition to *Don’t Look Up* to frame how pop culture illustrates this challenge.
:::


<!-- ## 10: Class Discussion on *Don’t Look Up*

**Discussion Questions:**  
1. "What do you think the movie says about how society handles urgent crises like climate change?"  
2. "What are the biggest obstacles to communicating the urgency of climate action?"  

---

## 7: Wrapping Up on First Half

### Core Message:  
- Climate change is a **scientific fact**, but narratives influence our willingness to act.  
- This semester, we’ll learn to critically analyze these narratives and develop effective arguments.  

**Next Steps:**  

- Learn more and prepare for role-playing exercises next session after the break!



## 8. Assessment Overview

- **Participation Grades**:
  - **7/10**: Presented once during the semester.
  - **8.5/10**: Presented twice.
  - **10/10**: Presented three or more times.
- Participation is cumulative and rewards consistent engagement.
- Other assessment items:
  - Midterm and final projects (details in future sessions).

---

## 9. Why Role-Playing Matters

- **Purpose**: Explore diverse perspectives on climate change.
- **Method**: Simulate real-world tensions and decision-making processes.
- **Outcome**: Learn to structure arguments and craft narratives tied to societal roles.

---

## 10. This Week’s Groups

- **Pro-CC Specialists:**  
  - Advocate for prioritizing climate action.  
  - Grounded in scientific consensus, long-term benefits, and moral responsibility.

- **Anti-CC Specialists:**  
  - Argue against prioritizing climate action.  
  - Highlight economic costs, competing priorities, and feasibility concerns.

---

## 11. Starting Next Week: Vocational Groups

- **Six Vocational Groups:**  
  1. Logistics/Transportation  
  2. Farming/Food Procurement  
  3. Energy and Industry  
  4. Policy-Makers/Decision Makers  
  5. Technology and Innovation  
  6. Service/Urban Workers  

- **Logistics for Next Week:**  
  - Groups will be assigned via a lottery system at the start of class.
  - You will define a persona within your assigned group to deeply engage with the topic.

---

## 12. Persona Creation for Today

- Define your **Pro/Anti-CC Specialist persona**:
  - **Pro-CC Example:**  
    - A climate scientist, renewable energy CEO, or youth activist.
  - **Anti-CC Example:**  
    - A corporate lobbyist, skeptical journalist, or concerned taxpayer.

- Take **5 minutes** to decide:
  - **Who are you?**
  - **What motivates your stance?**

---

## 13. Today’s Topic: US vs. AI

- How should humanity approach the development of AI, especially in the context of climate change?
    - Should we be **hostile** to AI development, focusing on its risks and energy costs?
    - Or should we seek **co-existence**, leveraging AI's potential to address climate change?



## 14. Pro-AI Arguments

- AI can be a powerful tool to combat climate change:
  1. **Optimizing energy use**:  
     - AI models can optimize renewable energy grids and improve efficiency.
  2. **Climate solutions**:  
     - AI can model climate scenarios and suggest actionable policies.
  3. **Promoting acceptance**:  
     - AI-driven communication tools (e.g., personalized messaging) can increase public awareness and engagement.

- AI increases **productivity**:  
  - By automating repetitive tasks, AI frees up resources for innovation in green technologies.

---

## 15. Anti-AI Arguments

- **Energy-intensive technology**:  
  - AI training models (e.g., large language models) consume enormous amounts of energy.  
    - Example: Training one large model can emit as much carbon as five cars over their lifetime.  

- **Risk of distraction**:  
  - Over-reliance on AI may shift focus from simpler, more immediate solutions (e.g., lifestyle changes, policy enforcement).

- **Social challenges**:  
  1. AI might exacerbate inequality, leaving vulnerable populations further behind.  
  2. AI-driven misinformation can hinder climate action.

---

## 16. Group Discussions

- Spend **10 minutes** discussing in your groups:
  - **Pro-CC Specialists**: Argue for embracing AI as a key tool in the fight against climate change.  
  - **Anti-CC Specialists**: Argue that AI poses more risks than benefits in the climate context.  

- Prepare 2-3 key points tied to:
  - Energy use.
  - Solutions or distractions.
  - Social impacts.

---

## 17. Group Presentations

- Each group presents their stance:
  - **Pro-AI Specialists**: 5 minutes.
  - **Anti-AI Specialists**: 5 minutes.

- Focus on the interplay between AI development and the urgency of addressing climate change.

---

## 18. Debrief and Takeaways

- **Pro-AI Highlights**:  
  - AI as a tool for innovation, efficiency, and public engagement.
- **Anti-AI Highlights**:  
  - AI’s energy costs and potential social risks outweigh its benefits.

- **Broader Question**:  
  - "How do societal priorities shape our relationship with technology and climate action?"
