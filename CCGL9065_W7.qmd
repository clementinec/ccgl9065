## 11: Known Historical Discrepancies of Climate-Change Related Stories

## Mideval Warm Period

![Mideval Warm Period (Wikipedia)](data/MWP.png)

## 11.1: **Medieval Warm Period (MWP) Debate**:

  - **Controversy**: 
    The MWP refers to a time from about 950 to 1250 AD when temperatures were thought to be **unusually warm** in some regions of the North Atlantic. The debate centers around the extent, timing, and global impact of the MWP.
  - **Differing Interpretations**: 
    - Some climate change skeptics have used the MWP to argue that _current global warming is part of a natural climate variability._
    - In contrast, the majority of climate scientists contend that current warming is __unprecedented and largely anthropogenic__.
  - **Impact on Climate Change Discourse**: 
    The controversy has fueled discussions about the reliability of climate models and historical climate data reconstructions.

## Climate-Change as Fake, News from Trump's Claim

> “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.”  
> *(Trump, Tweet, 2012)*

:::{.notes}

**Critical Assessment (Speaker Notes):**  
Encourage students to verify statements through reputable, science-based historical timelines and scholarly publications, demonstrating that conspiracy claims typically lack credible sources.
:::

### Explanation & Fact-check

**Explanation:**  
This is a conspiracy theory claiming climate change was intentionally fabricated by China to damage U.S. economic interests, without scientific or historical basis.

**Fact-check:**  
Climate science dates back to the late 19th century, long before contemporary Chinese economic policies. It’s supported by NASA, NOAA, and the IPCC.

## Climate-Change as Fake, News from Trump's Claim, Case Two

> “It used to not be climate change, it used to be global warming… That wasn’t working too well because it was getting too cold all over the place.”  
> *(Trump, Interview with Piers Morgan, 2018)*

:::{.notes}

**Critical Assessment (Speaker Notes):**  
Educate students on the difference between short-term weather (variable) and climate (long-term averages and trends) to prevent conflating temporary phenomena with overall climate patterns.
:::

### Explanation & Fact-check

**Explanation:**  
Trump confuses short-term weather variations with the long-term trend of climate change.

**Fact-check:**  
Global temperatures have consistently risen over decades (NASA/IPCC). Terminology shifted to "climate change" reflecting broader impacts.

## Hocky Stick Graph 

![Hocky Stick Graph (Wikipedia)](data/hockey.jpg)

## 11.2: **Hockey Stick Graph Controversy**:

  - **Controversy**: 
    - The "hockey stick graph," first published by Michael Mann and colleagues in the late 1990s, showed a sharp rise in global temperatures in the 20th century after a long period of relative stability, resembling a hockey stick. 
    - Critics questioned the data sources, methodologies, and statistical techniques used to create the graph.
  - **Differing Interpretations**: 
    - Skeptics used the controversy to challenge the consensus on anthropogenic global warming,  
    - numerous scientific bodies and researchers have since reaffirmed the graph's general conclusion about significant recent warming.
  - **Impact on Climate Change Discourse**: The controversy highlighted the challenges of paleoclimate reconstruction and the politicization of climate science.

## Climategate
![Climate Gate Snippet](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P70SlEqX7oY/maxresdefault.jpg)

## 11.3: **Climategate Email Controversy**:
    
  - **Controversy**: 
    - In 2009, a significant number of emails and documents were leaked from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit (CRU). 
    - Critics alleged that the emails showed scientists discussing _ways to manipulate data and suppress dissenting views_.
  - **Differing Interpretations**: 
    - Climate change skeptics claimed the emails proved scientific misconduct and conspiracy among climate scientists. 
    - However, several independent investigations cleared the scientists of wrongdoing, concluding that the emails were taken out of context.
  - **Impact on Climate Change Discourse**: 
    "Climategate" fueled public skepticism about climate science and the integrity of climate researchers, despite the lack of evidence for scientific fraud.

## Climate-Change as Fake, News from Trump's Claim, Case Three

> “The ocean is going to rise by 1/100th of an inch over 400 years. That's not our problem.”  
> *(Trump, Rally, December 2015)*

### Explanation & Fact-check

**Explanation:**  
Trump significantly understates sea-level rise projections and the associated risks.

**Fact-check:**  
IPCC projects global sea levels could rise approximately 0.3–1.1 meters by 2100, causing severe impacts on coastal communities.


## 12.1 Enhancing Perspectives
### What We Are Doing:

  - Engaging in a role-play activity that simulates a debate around the theme of Decolonizing Ocean Science within the Hong Kong context.
  - You will assume roles advocating for “pro-climate-change” (Pro-CC) policies and anti-climate-change (Anti-CC) viewpoints, as well as various stakeholder positions.

### Why We Are Doing It:
  - To explore diverse perspectives on complex issues that intersects futurologists, fake news, and power of narratives in face of historical accounts.
  - To understand the implications of policy decisions and scientific practices on different communities and the environment.
  - **To foster empathy and critical thinking** by stepping into the shoes of various stakeholders affected by these issues.

## 12.2 Enhancing Perspectives (Continued)
### How does these activities help:
  - They highlights the nuances in the climate change debate on various issues - angles of historical accounts that can/may be contradictory for this week. 
  - Encouraging informed discussions on how traditional and scientific knowledge can complement each other in addressing pressing environmental challenges.

###  Our Classroom Environment:
  - This is a **safe space** for exploration and discussion. 
  - There are no wrong answers here, only opportunities to learn and understand different viewpoints.
  - Respect and open-mindedness are our guiding principles. Every opinion shared is valued and contributes to our collective learning.
  - Feedback and reflection are encouraged. This is a chance to voice thoughts, ask questions, and grow from the experience.
