# The Big Picture

Your final portfolio demonstrates your ability to **move people to action** on climate change. Everything you've learned — the debates, the storytelling, the fact-checking — comes together here.

::: {.callout-important}
## The Golden Rule
**Everything must be fact-checkable.** You're learning to persuade with *real stories*, not to deceive with fake ones. The power of a spectacle comes from its **truth**.
:::

## The Formula You've Practiced

Throughout this course, you've been building spectacles using:

$$\text{Fact} + \text{Human Story} + \text{Stakes} = \text{Spectacle}$$

Your final deliverables must demonstrate mastery of this formula.

## The Three Pillars (All Deliverables)

| Pillar | Question | What It Means |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Verifiability** | Can it be fact-checked? | Every claim has a credible source |
| **Creativity** | Is your spectacle compelling? | Facts transformed into emotional narratives |
| **Conciseness** | Did you say it efficiently? | Every word earns its place |

---

# Weekly Themes Reference

Your final work should draw from themes explored across the semester:

| Week | Theme | Key Tensions |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | AI & Climate | Technology as savior vs. energy burden |
| 2 | Food Systems | Transform diet vs. preserve choice |
| 3 | Fashion/LCA | Consume less vs. affordable access |
| 4 | Energy | Transition now vs. pragmatic approach |
| 5 | Cities | Green infrastructure vs. housing needs |
| 6 | Economics | System change vs. market solutions |
| 7 | Truth & Narratives | Scientific consensus vs. healthy skepticism |
| 8 | Oceans | Conservation vs. livelihoods |
| 9 | Refugees | Open borders vs. local stability |
| 10 | Systems Thinking | Holistic view vs. targeted solutions |
| 11 | Space | Fix Earth first vs. explore & expand |

**Your final work should synthesize insights from multiple weeks** — not just one topic.

# Deliverable 1: Final Reflective Essay (20%)

## Specifications

- **Length:** 750 words maximum (hard cap)
- **Format:** 12pt Times New Roman, double-spaced, APA citations
- **Sources:** Minimum 4 credible sources (peer-reviewed, major news, official reports)

## Structure

| Section | Words | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Hook** | 50–75 | A vivid fact or human story that grabs attention |
| **Context** | 100 | Local (Hong Kong) and global stakes |
| **Solution** | 300 | What you propose, why it works, how to implement |
| **Impact + Action** | 150 | Who benefits + specific next step for reader |
| **Conclusion** | 50 | Memorable takeaway |

## Applying the Formula

::: {.callout-tip}
## Weak vs. Strong Opening

**Weak:** "Climate change is a serious problem that affects many people."

**Strong:** "In 2024, a fisherman in Sai Kung pulled up his nets and found jellyfish where grouper used to be. The water is too warm now. His grandfather fished these waters for sixty years — he lasted three."

The strong version has a **fact** (warming waters), a **human story** (the fisherman), and **stakes** (a livelihood destroyed).
:::

## What Gets an A

- Crystal clear thesis with one memorable solution
- Compelling evidence that moves readers emotionally
- Seamless structure that builds to an inevitable conclusion
- Polished prose with zero filler
- Call to action that readers could do *today*

## What Gets a D

- Vague claims without sources ("studies show...")
- Generic statements that could apply to any topic
- Chaotic structure that loses the reader
- Padding to reach word count
- No clear action for the reader

- **Script:** ≤150 spoken words in English
- **Format:** HD (1080p), MP4, ≤100MB
- **Components:** Your voice + visuals + subtitles
- **Credits:** All media must be CC0, Creative Commons, or original

## Structure

| Segment | Duration | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Hook** | 5–8 sec | Shocking stat or personal story |
| **Core** | 40–45 sec | Problem + your solution, succinctly |
| **CTA** | 10–15 sec | Direct, specific next step |

## Applying the Formula

Your 60 seconds must be a **spectacle** — not a lecture.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Weak vs. Strong Video Opening

**Weak:** "Today I want to talk about climate change and why it matters..."

**Strong:** [Image of dried-up reservoir] "This used to be Hong Kong's water supply. By 2050, it could look like this every summer. I'm going to tell you how to stop it."

The strong version hooks immediately with stakes the viewer can *see*.

# Deliverable 3: Collage/Poster (20%)

- **Format:** PDF
- **Text:** ≤50 words total (headline + CTA only)
- **Required:** At least 1 data visualization + 1 powerful image
- **Credits:** APA citations in small font (not overpowering visuals)

## Layout (Reference Only)

The layout below is just **one example** — you don't have to follow it. Feel free to experiment with composition, asymmetry, or unconventional arrangements. What matters is **visual impact** and **clarity of message**, not adherence to a template.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│     HEADLINE (8-10 words)       │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│                                 │
│       CENTRAL GRAPHIC           │
│     (your most powerful image)  │
│                                 │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  Data 1  │  Data 2  │  Data 3   │
│  (stat)  │  (stat)  │  (stat)   │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│     CTA: URL or QR Code         │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

::: {.callout-note}
## Creative Freedom
This is art, not a form. Break the grid if it serves your message. The only non-negotiables are: headline, at least one data point, one strong image, and a visible CTA.
:::

## Applying the Formula

Your collage IS a spectacle — visual instead of verbal.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Weak vs. Strong Headline

**Weak:** "Climate Change Is Bad For The Environment"

**Strong:** "Your Jeans Drank More Water Than You Will This Year"

The strong version is specific, surprising, and personal.
:::

# Weekly Research & Reflection (20%)

Your Notion portfolio documents your journey through the semester.

## Weekly Requirements

Each week, your Notion entry should include:

1. **Fact** — A specific, sourced statistic or claim
2. **Story** — A real human example (not hypothetical)
3. **Spectacle** — Your transformation of fact + story into emotional narrative

## Format Template

```markdown
**[PRO-CLIMATE or PRO-DEVELOPMENT]**

📊 **My Fact:**
[Specific claim with source]

📖 **My Story:**
[Real person/event with source]

💥 **My Spectacle:**
[Your 1-2 sentence transformation]

🔗 Full research: [Notion link]
```

## Word Limits

| Component | Target | Maximum |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Weekly Notion entry | 300–500 words | 750 words |
| Slack post | 100–150 words | 200 words |
| Spectacle draft | 1–2 sentences | 3 sentences |

**Penalty:** Exceeding maximum by >20% loses one grade step (A → A-, B+ → B).

---

# Participation (20%)

Participation is split into two equal components:

## In-Class Participation (10%)

Present **3 times** during the semester to earn the full 10%.

- Presentations happen during the debate/activity portion of lectures
- Can be as an individual or representing your group
- Quality matters less than showing up and contributing

## Tutorial Participation (10%)

Attend a **majority of tutorials** (more than half) to earn the full 10%.

- Tutorials provide valuable prep for debates and portfolio work
- Active engagement expected, but attendance is the baseline requirement

---

# Quick Self-Check Before Submitting

Ask yourself:

- [ ] Can someone Google my facts and find them true?
- [ ] Did I cite specific, credible sources?
- [ ] Is my story about real people/events, not hypotheticals?
- [ ] Does my spectacle make people *feel* something?
- [ ] Could I cut 20% without losing meaning?
- [ ] Would I be comfortable defending this in a debate?
- [ ] Is my call to action specific and doable *today*?

If you answered "no" to any of these, **revise before submitting**.

# Resources & Support

- **Office Hours:** After class, tutorials, or by appointment
- **Slack:** Reach out to us on Slack

::: {.callout-note}
## Quality Over Quantity
Aim to create something you'd proudly share on LinkedIn, Instagram, or hang on a public bulletin board — something that truly **moves people to act**.
