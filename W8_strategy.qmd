# Last Week's Strategy: The Pre-Mortem

## Quick Callback

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
Last week's strategy: **The Pre-Mortem**

*Assume you failed. Now fix it.*

**Anyone try it?** Did you imagine your argument bombing and then strengthen the weak points?

# The Persuasion Playbook | Strategy #7

## The Fork

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; background: #2c3e50; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px;"}
*"Are you going to let your family suffer, or are you going to act now?"*

The trick isn't the answer.

**The trick is that both options accept your frame.**

## The Science

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
This is the **False Dilemma** — or in sales, **The Fork**.

Present two choices that both serve your goal.

*"Do you want the red one or the blue one?"*
(Not: "Do you want to buy a car?")

The brain loves binary choices. Multiple options = paralysis.

**Two options = decision.**

## You Just Saw It

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
When someone said:

*"We can either regulate AI now, or let corporations decide for us."*

Notice what's missing?

**"Do nothing" wasn't an option.** Because they didn't put it there.

## Next Week's Challenge

::: {style="font-size: 2em; background: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px; text-align: center;"}
**End with two options — both of which support your case.**

Remove the third option before they think of it.
