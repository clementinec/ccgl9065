# CCGL9065 Slack Workspace Setup

## The Model: Weekly Battlefields

Students maintain a **personal Notion page** (their portfolio) and share findings to **weekly Slack battlefield channels**. No fixed groups — students drift between positions and topics based on interest.

---

## Channel Structure

### Core Channels
- `#announcements` — Instructor posts only
- `#general` — Open discussion, questions
- `#resources` — Shared articles, videos, useful links

### Weekly Battlefield Channels
Created fresh each week:

- `#w1-battlefield-ai` — Week 1: Us vs. the AI
- `#w2-battlefield-food` — Week 2: Food Systems
- `#w3-battlefield-energy` — Week 3: Energy
- `#w4-battlefield-cities` — Week 4: Cities & Architecture
- ... (continue for each week)

---

## How It Works

### Before Class (Homework)

1. **Research** the week's topic
2. **Add findings** to your personal Notion page
3. **Post to Slack** — share your best fact/story to the battlefield channel
4. **Tag your position:** `[PRO CLIMATE]` or `[PRO DEVELOPMENT]`

### During Class

**First 50 minutes:** Instructor presents facts, stakes, and angles of attack for both sides.

**Second 50 minutes:**
1. Students find others with similar positions
2. Groups synthesize their best arguments
3. Groups present to the class
4. Debate between sides

### After Class

- Best contributions get added to the **Channel Canvas**
- Students can continue discussing in the channel
- Browse other weeks' channels for ideas

## Slack Post Format

When posting to a battlefield channel:

```
**[PRO CLIMATE]** or **[PRO DEVELOPMENT]**

📊 **My Fact:**
[One key statistic or data point]
Source: [link]

📖 **My Story:**
[One real case in 2-3 sentences]
Source: [link]

💥 **My Spectacle:**
"[Your emotionally compelling version]"

🔗 **Full research:** [Link to your Notion page]
```

## Channel Canvas
