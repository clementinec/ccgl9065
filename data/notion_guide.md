## Troubleshooting

**"I don't have a Notion account"**
→ Sign up free at [notion.so](https://www.notion.so) using your HKU email.

**"I can't see the Duplicate button"**
→ Make sure you're logged into Notion first.

**"My link says 'Private page'"**
→ You need to publish it (Step 3). Just sharing isn't enough.

**"I made changes but they're not showing"**
→ Changes auto-sync. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) if needed.
