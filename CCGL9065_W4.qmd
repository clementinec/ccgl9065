# Last Week's Strategy: The Barnum Slide

## Quick Callback

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
Last week's strategy: **The Barnum Slide**

*Statements that feel specific but apply to everyone create false intimacy.*

**Anyone try it?** Did you write a sentence that felt personal but was actually universal?

Did faces react?
:::

---

## Something You Took Away Last Week

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8;"}
Week 3 gave you a tool: **Life Cycle Assessment.**

You learned that where you **draw the system boundary** changes the entire answer.

- Cotton tote vs. plastic bag? Depends on *how many times you reuse it.*
- Beyond Burger vs. chicken? Depends on *whether you count land use.*
- Organic cotton vs. conventional? Depends on *which impact you measure.*
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; margin-top: 30px; font-weight: bold; color: #8e44ad;"}
That's not just an LCA skill — that's **systems thinking.** And you'll need it again today.
:::

---

## From Products → Energy Systems

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8;"}
Last week: *"Is this product really green?"*

This week: *"Is this energy source really clean?"*

**Same question. Bigger system boundary.**

Solar panels look perfect — until you widen the boundary to include **timing** (when the sun shines vs. when you need power), **storage** (where does the excess go?), and **grid stability** (who fills the gap at sunset?).
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-top: 25px; background: #f0f0f0; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;"}
This is your portable toolkit — system-boundary thinking works for fashion, energy, food, transport. Every week builds on it.

## The Core Tension

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
| PRO-CLIMATE | PRO-DEVELOPMENT |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Rapid decarbonization | Gradual transition |
| Accept higher costs now | Keep energy affordable |
| Government mandates | Market incentives |
| End fossil fuels immediately | Bridge fuels (gas) acceptable |
| Future generations | Current livelihoods |

**This tension drives every energy policy debate.**

# But First: A Test of Your Instincts

---

## Quick Poll

::: {style="font-size: 1.8em; line-height: 1.8;"}
Which energy source has killed the **most** people per unit of electricity produced?

A) Nuclear

B) Coal

C) Solar

D) Wind

**Vote now.**
:::

---

## The Answer (You Probably Got It Right)

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
Coal kills approximately **24.6 people per TWh** of electricity produced.

That includes mining accidents, air pollution, respiratory disease.

Nuclear? **0.03 deaths per TWh.** Even including Chernobyl and Fukushima.
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; margin-top: 30px; color: #7f8c8d;"}
OK, that one was easy. But here's where it gets weird...

:::

---

## Wait — Solar and Wind Kill People?

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
Solar: **0.05 deaths per TWh.** Wind: **0.04 deaths per TWh.**

Both are *higher* than nuclear.

Rooftop installation falls. Manufacturing accidents. Mining for rare earth minerals.
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; margin-top: 30px; background: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;"}
**The point:** The energy source the public fears most (nuclear) is statistically the safest. The one they trust most (solar) is slightly more dangerous per kWh. Perception ≠ reality.

## Six Sources, One Table

::: {style="font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.6;"}
| Source | Best For | Biggest Problem | HK Viability |
|--------|----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Solar** | Rooftops, building façades | Intermittent; storage needed; Duck Curve | **Medium** — limited rooftop space |
| **Wind** | Offshore (South China Sea) | High cost; marine/bird impact | **Medium** — offshore potential |
| **Hydropower** | Dams, river systems | Ecosystem disruption; land required | **Very Low** — no rivers |
| **Geothermal** | Volcanic/tectonic regions | Drilling cost; seismic risk | **Very Low** — wrong geology |
| **Biomass** | Waste processing | Deforestation; emissions from combustion | **Low** — limited feedstock |
| **Tidal/Wave** | Coastal areas with strong currents | High cost; early-stage technology | **Low-Medium** — research stage |

The Duck Curve: midday solar floods the grid, evening demand spikes when the sun disappears. The gap is the problem.
:::

---

## The Duck Curve: Three Problems in One

::: {style="font-size: 1.3em; line-height: 1.7;"}

::: {style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around; margin-top: 20px;"}
::: {style="width: 30%; background: #f39c12; color: white; padding: 25px; border-radius: 10px;"}
::: {style="font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: bold;"}
The Belly (Midday)
:::
::: {style="margin-top: 10px;"}
Solar floods the grid when demand is moderate. Supply > demand. No battery storage at scale. Wholesale prices go **negative** — California pays Arizona to absorb the excess because it's physically easier than shutting off thousands of rooftop panels.
:::
:::

::: {style="width: 30%; background: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 25px; border-radius: 10px;"}
::: {style="font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: bold;"}
The Neck (4–7 PM Ramp)
:::
::: {style="margin-top: 10px;"}
Sun sets. Solar drops to zero in ~3 hours. But demand **spikes** — everyone comes home, cooks, runs AC. The grid must add **~13,000 MW in 3 hours**. Only gas peaker plants can ramp that fast. They're expensive and dirty.
:::
:::

::: {style="width: 30%; background: #2c3e50; color: white; padding: 25px; border-radius: 10px;"}
::: {style="font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: bold;"}
The Tail (Evening Peak)
:::
::: {style="margin-top: 10px;"}
All that solar capacity contributes **nothing** at the moment demand is highest. The evening peak is met almost entirely by fossil fuels — just like before solar existed.
:::
:::
:::

:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; margin-top: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #8e44ad; text-align: center;"}
The cruel irony: the more solar you build, the deeper the belly and the steeper the ramp. More solar makes the duck *worse* — until storage catches up.

# Case Studies: Real People, Real Consequences

## California: The Paradox on Maria's Roof

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Maria** in San Diego installed rooftop solar in 2015. Her electricity bill dropped from **$200/month to $12**. She told everyone: *"Solar pays for itself."*

Then San Diego Gas & Electric changed the rules. **Time-of-use pricing** meant Maria was selling power at midday — when it was worth almost nothing — and buying it back at peak evening rates.

Her savings dropped to **$40/month**. Her panels still worked perfectly. The economics didn't.

Meanwhile, California was **paying Arizona to take its excess solar power** — negative wholesale prices. The grid couldn't handle what it asked for.

## Germany: Klaus and the Dead Town {background-image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Aerial_image_of_the_Hambach_surface_mine_%28view_from_the_southeast%29.jpg" background-size="cover" background-opacity="0.3"}

::: {style="font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Klaus** worked in the lignite mines of Schwarze Pumpe, Lausitz, for 30 years. His father mined there. His grandfather too. Three generations of brown coal.

The Energiewende shut his mine. The government promised retraining. Klaus was 55.

Five years later: **60% of retrained workers** in the Lausitz region were unemployed or in worse-paying jobs. The town's population **halved**. The local school closed. The pub closed.

And Germany's CO₂ emissions? **Barely changed for years** — because Berlin simultaneously shut down zero-carbon nuclear plants and temporarily burned *more coal* to fill the gap.

## Ontario: The Bill That Brought Down a Government

::: {style="font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 1.8;"}
The **Henderson family** in rural Ontario had a $120/month electricity bill in 2009. That year, Premier Dalton McGuinty signed the **Green Energy Act**. *"We will create a new industry and thousands of jobs."*

Feed-in tariffs guaranteed solar producers **80 cents per kWh** — when market price was 3–5 cents. Someone had to pay the difference. The Hendersons did.

By 2016, their bill was **$250/month**. The "Global Adjustment" charge — the hidden cost of renewable subsidies — was *larger than the cost of actual electricity*.

Ontario lost **300,000 manufacturing jobs** (energy costs were one factor). In 2018, the governing Liberals won **one seat**. The worst electoral defeat in the province's history.

## What Do These Stories Have in Common?

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
None of them are anti-renewable.

All of them are **anti-simplicity**.

- California proves: **timing and storage matter** as much as generation.
- Germany proves: **sequencing matters** — don't kill nuclear before renewables can replace it.
- Ontario proves: **cost distribution matters** — who pays for the transition?
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 30px; font-weight: bold; color: #8e44ad;"}
The transition is necessary. The question is how to not destroy people along the way.

Castle Peak Power Station, Tuen Mun — one of the largest coal-fired plants in Asia.

## "Why Tuen Mun Again?"

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
In 2007, when the government proposed building *another* polluting facility in Tuen Mun, District Councillor **Lung Shui-hing** stood up:

> *"Why Tuen Mun again? The government is treating the district like a garbage dump where all the unwanted facilities are found."*

All 13 councillors voted unanimously against. They noted Tuen Mun already housed: Castle Peak Power Station, a recycling park, a steel mill, oil tanks, and a landfill.

Government officials later acknowledged that **easterly winds — which carry pollutants away from the main urban areas — influenced site selection.**
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-top: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #e74c3c;"}
The pollution isn't accidental. The location was chosen because the people living downwind were deemed less likely to complain.

> *"I coughed uncontrollably, drawing odd stares and dirty looks from people around me on the street."*

**Dr Loretta So Kit-ying**, respiratory medicine specialist: *"Nitrogen dioxide will cause irritation to the airways, leading to a range of respiratory diseases."*

In 2015, Tuen Mun recorded [**395 hours**]{style="color: orangered;"} of "high" or above air quality readings — the **worst in Hong Kong** for the second consecutive year.

# Today's Debate

## The Motion

::: {style="font-size: 1.8em; text-align: center; background: #2c3e50; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 15px;"}
**"Hong Kong should double its nuclear energy imports from mainland China to achieve carbon neutrality, rather than investing in local renewable energy."**
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.3em; text-align: center; margin-top: 30px;"}
PRO-CLIMATE argues **against**. PRO-DEVELOPMENT argues **for**.

*(Or does it? Which side are you really on?)*

Against (PRO-CLIMATE?)
:::
::: {style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-top: 15px; line-height: 1.6;"}
- Energy dependence on mainland China
- Nuclear waste and accident risk
- HK has wind + solar potential (48%)
- Local jobs in renewable sector
- **But...** nuclear is zero-carbon. Opposing it means more fossil fuels *now*.

For (PRO-DEVELOPMENT?)
:::
::: {style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-top: 15px; line-height: 1.6;"}
- Nuclear is safest per kWh (0.03 deaths/TWh)
- Reliable baseload — no Duck Curve problem
- HK has no space for large-scale renewables
- Proven, affordable, already 25% of supply
- **But...** you're outsourcing your energy future to another jurisdiction.

## Sensory Hijack

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; background: #2c3e50; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px;"}
People holding a **warm cup of coffee** rated strangers as more trustworthy than those holding iced drinks.

They had no idea the cup mattered.
:::

---

## The Science

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
This is **Embodied Cognition** (Williams & Bargh, 2008).

The body doesn't just receive information — it **shapes judgment**.

- Physical warmth → social warmth
- Heaviness → seriousness
- Roughness → difficulty

**The brain takes sensory shortcuts constantly.**

## You Just Saw It — In the Energy Debate

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8;"}
The arguments that landed today weren't abstract policy statements.

They made you **feel something in your body**.

Not "coal combustion produces particulate matter affecting respiratory health."

But: *"Mrs Ho coughs uncontrollably on the street. Strangers give her dirty looks. She doesn't know how to explain that the air itself is making her sick."*

Not "energy transitions have economic costs."

But: *"Klaus is 55. His mine closed. His pension vanished. His town is dying."*
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; margin-top: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #8e44ad;"}
That's sensory hijack. Body-first, logic second.

## Next Week's Challenge

::: {style="font-size: 2em; background: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px; text-align: center;"}
**Make your audience physically uncomfortable — on purpose.**

One image. One sentence. Body-first.

| Topic | "Wait, What?" Opening |
|-------|----------------------|
| Nuclear safety | "Nuclear has killed fewer people per kWh than solar. Yes, including Chernobyl." |
| Solar limits | "California has so much solar it pays other states to take it — then fires up gas plants at sunset." |
| Wind disposal | "A single turbine blade is longer than a 747 wing. It goes to landfill." |
| HK EVs | "Your Tesla charged in HK might be dirtier than a Prius — the grid is 70% fossil." |
| Germany | "Germany spent €500B on green energy. Its CO₂ barely changed for a decade." |
| Scale | "More solar hits the Earth in one hour than humanity uses in a year." |
| Carbon footprint | "Your 'personal carbon footprint'? BP's ad agency invented that in 2005." |

## Appendix: Anita Tang's Rooftop Solar

::: {style="font-size: 1.3em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Anita Tang** (56) and her architect husband **Stephen** (62) installed solar panels at Fairview Park, Yuen Long, in October 2018.

- Installation cost: **HK$180,000**
- Monthly earnings from CLP Feed-in Tariff: **HK$2,500–3,000**
- Expected payback: ~6 years
- Approval took **two months** instead of two weeks

Anita: *"Some suppliers said they were registered, but we couldn't find their address."*

Village house owner **Newman Lau Man-choi** in Clear Water Bay can only use half his rooftop — by regulation.

## Appendix: Detailed Renewable Energy Data

::: {style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.5;"}
**Solar**: Abundant sunlight; low operating costs. But: high initial costs, requires significant space, production variability. Duck Curve problem at scale.

**Wind**: Clean and renewable; offshore potential. But: high installation/maintenance costs, marine and bird life impact. Blade disposal problem.

**Hydropower**: Reliable, low GHG. But: ecosystem disruption, zero feasibility in HK.

**Geothermal**: Consistent, small footprint. But: wrong geology for HK. [EMSD project](https://re.emsd.gov.hk/english/energy/thermal/ther_re.html) is ground-source heat pumps only.

**Biomass**: Uses organic waste. But: deforestation risk, combustion emissions.

**Tidal/Wave**: Predictable, minimal visual impact. But: high cost, early-stage. [CityU research](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/see_mer/tidal-Intro.htm) exploring potential.
