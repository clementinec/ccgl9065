# But First: A Test of Your Instincts

---

## Quick Poll

::: {style="font-size: 1.8em; line-height: 1.8;"}
Which energy source has killed the **most** people per unit of electricity produced?

A) Nuclear

B) Coal

C) Solar

D) Wind

**Vote now.**
:::

---

## The Answer (You Probably Got It Right)

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
Coal kills approximately **24.6 people per TWh** of electricity produced.

That includes mining accidents, air pollution, respiratory disease.

Nuclear? **0.03 deaths per TWh.** Even including Chernobyl and Fukushima.
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; margin-top: 30px; color: #7f8c8d;"}
OK, that one was easy. But here's where it gets weird...

:::

---

## Wait — Solar and Wind Kill People?

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
Solar: **0.05 deaths per TWh.** Wind: **0.04 deaths per TWh.**

Both are *higher* than nuclear.

Rooftop installation falls. Manufacturing accidents. Mining for rare earth minerals.
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; margin-top: 30px; background: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;"}
**The point:** The energy source the public fears most (nuclear) is statistically the safest. The one they trust most (solar) is slightly more dangerous per kWh. Perception ≠ reality.

**Assumption:** Germany's Energiewende made it greener.

**Reality:** Germany's CO₂ emissions **barely decreased for a decade** (2009–2019). Why? They shut down zero-carbon **nuclear plants** at the same time and temporarily burned **more coal** to fill the gap.

## Wind Turbine Blades Go to Landfill

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Assumption:** Wind energy is fully "clean."

**Reality:** A single wind turbine blade is **longer than a Boeing 747 wing** (up to 80m). Made of composite fiberglass. Currently **cannot be economically recycled.**

Thousands of blades are buried in landfills across the American Midwest every year.

## California Pays Other States to Take Its Solar Power

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Assumption:** More solar = always better.

**Reality:** On sunny spring days, California produces **so much solar** that wholesale electricity prices go **negative**. The state literally pays Arizona and Nevada to absorb the excess.

Meanwhile, at 7pm when the sun sets, California must fire up gas plants at full blast to cover demand. This is the **Duck Curve**.

## Your Hong Kong EV Runs on Coal

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Assumption:** Electric cars are always greener.

**Reality:** Hong Kong's grid is **~70% fossil fuels** (coal + natural gas). Only ~25% comes from Daya Bay nuclear imports.

An EV charged on Hong Kong's grid produces roughly **100-120g CO₂/km**. A fuel-efficient petrol hybrid? About **90-110g CO₂/km**.
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; margin-top: 30px; background: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;"}

## Why Am I Telling You This?

::: {style="font-size: 1.8em; line-height: 1.8;"}
Not to make you anti-renewable.

Not to say "nothing works."

But to show you: **the truth is complicated**.

And complicated truths make **better arguments**.

## The System Boundary Returns

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8;"}
Remember from last week? **"Sustainable compared to what, measured how, ending where?"**

- **Nuclear** looks terrifying if your boundary is "worst-case accident." Looks safest if your boundary is "deaths per TWh over all time."
- **Solar** looks perfect if you stop at the rooftop. Looks complicated if you include manufacturing, grid storage, and end-of-life disposal.
- **Wind** looks clean if you stop at generation. Looks messy if you include blade disposal.
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; margin-top: 30px; color: #7f8c8d;"}
Same data. Different boundaries. Completely different arguments.

## California: The Paradox on Maria's Roof

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Maria** in San Diego installed rooftop solar in 2015. Her electricity bill dropped from **$200/month to $12**. She told everyone: *"Solar pays for itself."*

Then San Diego Gas & Electric changed the rules. **Time-of-use pricing** meant Maria was selling power at midday — when it was worth almost nothing — and buying it back at peak evening rates.

Her savings dropped to **$40/month**. Her panels still worked perfectly. The economics didn't.

Meanwhile, California was **paying Arizona to take its excess solar power** — negative wholesale prices. The grid couldn't handle what it asked for.

## Germany: Klaus and the Dead Town

::: {style="font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Klaus** worked in the lignite mines of Schwarze Pumpe, Lausitz, for 30 years. His father mined there. His grandfather too. Three generations of brown coal.

The Energiewende shut his mine. The government promised retraining. Klaus was 55.

Five years later: **60% of retrained workers** in the Lausitz region were unemployed or in worse-paying jobs. The town's population **halved**. The local school closed. The pub closed.

And Germany's CO₂ emissions? **Barely changed for years** — because Berlin simultaneously shut down zero-carbon nuclear plants and temporarily burned *more coal* to fill the gap.

## Ontario: The Bill That Brought Down a Government

::: {style="font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 1.8;"}
The **Henderson family** in rural Ontario had a $120/month electricity bill in 2009. That year, Premier Dalton McGuinty signed the **Green Energy Act**. *"We will create a new industry and thousands of jobs."*

Feed-in tariffs guaranteed solar producers **80 cents per kWh** — when market price was 3–5 cents. Someone had to pay the difference. The Hendersons did.

By 2016, their bill was **$250/month**. The "Global Adjustment" charge — the hidden cost of renewable subsidies — was *larger than the cost of actual electricity*.

Ontario lost **300,000 manufacturing jobs** (energy costs were one factor). In 2018, the governing Liberals won **one seat**. The worst electoral defeat in the province's history.

## What Do These Stories Have in Common?

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8;"}
None of them are anti-renewable.

All of them are **anti-simplicity**.

- California proves: **timing and storage matter** as much as generation.
- Germany proves: **sequencing matters** — don't kill nuclear before renewables can replace it.
- Ontario proves: **cost distribution matters** — who pays for the transition?
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 30px; font-weight: bold; color: #8e44ad;"}
The transition is necessary. The question is how to not destroy people along the way.

Castle Peak Power Station, Tuen Mun — one of the largest coal-fired plants in Asia.
:::

## "Why Tuen Mun Again?"

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
In 2007, when the government proposed building *another* polluting facility in Tuen Mun, District Councillor **Lung Shui-hing** stood up:

> *"Why Tuen Mun again? The government is treating the district like a garbage dump where all the unwanted facilities are found."*

All 13 councillors voted unanimously against. They noted Tuen Mun already housed: Castle Peak Power Station, a recycling park, a steel mill, oil tanks, and a landfill.

Government officials later acknowledged that **easterly winds — which carry pollutants away from the main urban areas — influenced site selection.**
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-top: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #e74c3c;"}
The pollution isn't accidental. The location was chosen because the people living downwind were deemed less likely to complain.

**Mrs Ho**, 56, developed an airway allergy she attributes partly to Hong Kong's air pollution. She described it to SCMP:

> *"I coughed uncontrollably, drawing odd stares and dirty looks from people around me on the street."*

She became a Greenpeace volunteer, helping attach air monitoring tubes across Hong Kong. **Dr Loretta So Kit-ying**, respiratory medicine specialist at Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital, confirmed: *"Nitrogen dioxide will cause irritation to the airways, leading to a range of respiratory diseases."*

In 2015, Tuen Mun recorded [**395 hours**]{style="color: orangered;"} of "high" or above air quality readings — the **worst in Hong Kong** for the second consecutive year.

## Meanwhile, on Anita Tang's Roof

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Anita Tang** (56) and her architect husband **Stephen** (62) installed solar panels at their home in Fairview Park, Yuen Long, in October 2018.

- Installation cost: **HK$180,000**
- Monthly earnings from CLP Feed-in Tariff: **HK$2,500–3,000**
- Expected payback: ~6 years

But approval took **two months** instead of two weeks. The supplier market was chaotic — Anita: *"Some suppliers said they were registered, but we couldn't find their address."*

Hong Kong targets [**7.5%–10%**]{style="color: orangered;"} renewables by 2035. The Tangs are doing their part. But village house owners like **Newman Lau Man-choi** in Clear Water Bay can only use half their rooftop — by regulation.

## Hong Kong's Energy Reality

::: {style="font-size: 1.3em; line-height: 1.6;"}
| Factor | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| **Current renewable share** | ~1% (one of the lowest in developed economies) |
| **2035 target** | 7.5–10% renewables |
| **Largest clean source** | Daya Bay nuclear import (~25% of supply) |
| **Main fossil fuels** | Coal (~25%) + Natural Gas (~45%) |
| **Space constraint** | 1,100 km² total — one of densest cities on Earth |
| **Solar potential** | Limited rooftop area; buildings shade each other |
| **Offshore wind** | South China Sea potential, but typhoon risk + shipping lanes |
| **Waste-to-energy** | T-Park operational; I-Park under construction |

:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-top: 20px; color: #7f8c8d;"}
HK's biggest "clean" move was importing nuclear from Guangdong. The irony: the energy source the public fears most contributes the most to decarbonization.
:::

---

## The "Wait, What?" of Hong Kong Energy

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8;"}
HK's **offshore wind potential** alone could generate **32% of the city's electricity**.

HK's **solar rooftop potential** could generate another **16%**.

Together: nearly **half** of Hong Kong's electricity needs.

The government's 2035 target? **7.5–10%.**
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; margin-top: 30px; background: #2c3e50; color: white; padding: 30px; border-radius: 10px;"}
And in 2024, CLP stated that Hong Kong's clean energy future will be **"mostly nuclear"** — importing from Guangdong, not building local renewables.

*The city with 1,100 km² chose to outsource its energy conscience.*

## Places to Start Considering Your Position Statement

- **Global vs. Local**: How do California, Germany, and Ontario's lessons apply — or not apply — to a city of 7.5 million people on 1,100 km²?

- **Simplified Messaging**: What nuances are omitted when politicians say "renewables by 2035"? Why might these omissions be deliberate?

- **Policy Levers**: Given HK's constraints, what strategies could actually work? More nuclear imports? Floating solar? Regional grid sharing with Guangdong?

- **Long-Term Vision**: How might HK's energy landscape look in 2100? What realistic pathways exist for energy security?

**Say:** "Germany spent €500 billion on renewables. When the wind doesn't blow, they import nuclear from France. Klaus lost his job, his pension, his town. The carbon needle barely moved."

## PRO-TIP: Use the "Wait, What?" Technique

::: {style="font-size: 1.3em; line-height: 1.8;"}
| Topic | "Wait, What?" Opening |
|-------|----------------------|
| Nuclear safety | "Nuclear has killed fewer people per kWh than solar. Yes, including Chernobyl." |
| Solar limits | "California has so much solar it pays other states to take it — then fires up gas plants at sunset." |
| Germany | "Germany spent €500B on green energy. Its CO₂ emissions barely changed for a decade." |
| Wind disposal | "A single turbine blade is longer than a 747 wing. It goes to landfill." |
| HK EVs | "Your Tesla charged in Hong Kong might be dirtier than a Prius." |

Always include your source. "Wait, what?" only works if it's **true**.

## Create Your Persona

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em;"}
**PRO-CLIMATE personas:**

- Environmentalist pushing for immediate coal phase-out
- Parent in Tuen Mun near power station (like Mr. Wong)
- Youth climate activist
- Renewable energy startup founder

**PRO-DEVELOPMENT personas:**

- CLP executive managing grid stability
- Factory owner worried about electricity costs
- Energy minister balancing competing demands
- Coal worker facing job uncertainty
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 30px;"}
Who are you? What's your story? What do you fear losing?
:::

## The Real Question

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; line-height: 1.8; background: #2c3e50; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 15px;"}

**PRO-CLIMATE says:** "Coal is killing children. Close the plants. Klaus can retrain."

**PRO-DEVELOPMENT says:** "Klaus is 55. He lost his pension. His town is dying. No one hired him. He voted for the far-right. Was the transition worth it?"

**The real question:** How do we transition justly — fast enough to save the planet, slow enough not to destroy communities?

OK to Say
:::
::: {style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 15px;"}
- "Solar costs dropped 89% since 2010" *(IEA data)*

NOT OK
:::
::: {style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 15px;"}
- "Renewables can power everything now" *(ignores intermittency)*
- "Green energy destroys economies" *(exaggeration)*
- "Oil companies are literally killing people" *(unverifiable as stated)*
- "Nuclear is perfectly safe" *(overstated — low risk ≠ no risk)*

## Sensory Hijack

::: {style="font-size: 1.6em; background: #2c3e50; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px;"}
People holding a **warm cup of coffee** rated strangers as more trustworthy than those holding iced drinks.

They had no idea the cup mattered.
:::

---

## The Science

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
This is **Embodied Cognition** (Williams & Bargh, 2008).

The body doesn't just receive information — it **shapes judgment**.

- Physical warmth → social warmth
- Heaviness → seriousness
- Roughness → difficulty

**The brain takes sensory shortcuts constantly.**

## You Just Saw It — In the Energy Debate

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8;"}
The arguments that landed today weren't abstract policy statements.

They made you **feel something in your body**.

Not "coal combustion produces particulate matter affecting respiratory health."

But: *"Mrs Ho coughs uncontrollably on the street. Strangers give her dirty looks. She doesn't know how to explain that the air itself is making her sick."*

Not "energy transitions have economic costs."

But: *"Klaus is 55. His mine closed. His pension vanished. His town is dying."*
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; margin-top: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #8e44ad;"}
That's sensory hijack. Body-first, logic second.

## Next Week's Challenge

::: {style="font-size: 2em; background: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 10px; text-align: center;"}
**Make your audience physically uncomfortable — on purpose.**

One image. One sentence. Body-first.

# Appendix: Detailed Renewable Energy Data

---

## Appendix A: Solar Energy — Full Detail

::: {style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.6;"}
- **Pros**: Abundant sunlight; low operating costs; reduces electricity bills
- **Cons**: High initial installation costs; requires significant space; production variability due to weather
- **Short-term Impact**: Immediate reduction in carbon emissions and energy costs
- **Long-term Impact**: Enhances energy security and sustainability, but poses challenges for grid stability and storage solutions

**The Duck Curve Problem**: As solar capacity increases, midday generation floods the grid while evening demand spikes. The difference between midday minimum and evening peak creates the "duck" shape. California ISO documented this phenomenon extensively.
:::

---

## Appendix B: Wind Energy — Full Detail

::: {style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.6;"}
- **Pros**: Clean and renewable; potential for offshore installations
- **Cons**: Limited land availability; high installation and maintenance costs; marine and bird life impact
- **Short-term Impact**: Diversifies energy sources, reducing reliance on fossil fuels
- **Long-term Impact**: Steady energy supply if technological and environmental challenges addressed

**Blade Disposal Problem**: Turbine blades are made of composite fiberglass — strong, light, and nearly impossible to recycle economically. Average blade lifespan: 20-25 years. Tens of thousands will need replacement in the coming decade.
:::

---

## Appendix C: Hydropower, Geothermal, Biomass, Tidal — Full Detail

::: {style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.5;"}
**Hydropower**: Reliable and consistent; low GHG emissions. But: ecosystem disruption, high construction costs, and essentially zero feasibility in Hong Kong due to geography.

**Geothermal**: Consistent and reliable; small land footprint. But: requires specific geological conditions Hong Kong lacks. Local project via [EMSD](https://re.emsd.gov.hk/english/energy/thermal/ther_re.html) is small-scale ground-source heat pumps, not power generation.

**Biomass**: Utilizes organic waste; reduces landfill. But: can lead to deforestation; emits pollutants during combustion; requires significant land and water.

**Tidal/Wave**: Predictable energy source; minimal visual impact. But: high installation costs; early-stage technology; impact on marine ecosystems. [CityU research](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/see_mer/tidal-Intro.htm) is exploring local potential.
:::

---

## Appendix D: Hong Kong Renewable Energy — Detailed Landscape

::: {style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.6;"}
**Solar in HK**: Utilizes rooftop and building façade space. Limited by Hong Kong's dense urban environment — buildings shade each other. Government Feed-in Tariff (FiT) scheme pays up to HK$5/kWh for small installations.

**Wind in HK**: Offshore potential in South China Sea. CLP's Hok Un wind turbine was a pilot. Challenges: typhoons, shipping lanes, cost.

**Waste-to-Energy in HK**: T-Park (sludge treatment, operational). I-Park (integrated waste management, under construction in Shek Kwu Chau). Addresses waste crisis while generating power.

**Nuclear Import**: Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station provides ~25% of Hong Kong's electricity via CLP. This single contract is Hong Kong's largest decarbonization achievement — and it's not even "renewable" by most definitions.
