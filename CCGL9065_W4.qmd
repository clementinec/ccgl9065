# Building Your Energy Spectacle

## The Formula (Reminder)

::: {style="font-size: 1.8em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Fact** + **Human Story** + **Stakes** = **Spectacle**
:::

::: {style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around; margin-top: 50px;"}
::: {style="text-align: center; width: 30%; background: #ecf0f1; padding: 30px; border-radius: 10px;"}
::: {style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;"}
Weak
:::
"Solar energy costs have decreased"
:::

::: {style="text-align: center; width: 30%; background: #f39c12; color: white; padding: 30px; border-radius: 10px;"}
::: {style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;"}
Better
:::
"Solar costs dropped 89% since 2010"
:::

::: {style="text-align: center; width: 30%; background: #e74c3c; color: white; padding: 30px; border-radius: 10px;"}
::: {style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;"}
Spectacle
:::
"In 2010, solar was for hippies. In 2025, it's cheaper than coal. The oil companies knew — and lied."
:::
:::

## PRO-CLIMATE: Make It Personal

::: {style="background: #27ae60; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 15px; font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Don't say:** "Fossil fuels cause emissions."

**Say:** "Every breath your child takes in Tsim Sha Tsui contains particles from coal plants 100km away. You're paying for cheap electricity with their lungs."

**Don't say:** "We need renewable energy mandates."

**Say:** "Germany did it. California did it. Hong Kong says 'too expensive.' Is your child's health too expensive?"
:::

## PRO-DEVELOPMENT: Paint the Picture

::: {style="background: #3498db; color: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 15px; font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Don't say:** "Energy transitions are complex."

**Say:** "Ontario rushed renewables. Electricity bills doubled. Factories closed. Workers lost jobs. Is that the transition you want?"

**Don't say:** "We need reliable baseload power."

**Say:** "Germany spent €500 billion on renewables. When the wind doesn't blow, they import nuclear power from France. Guess who pays? The same families who can't afford heating."

# Scenario: Bringing It Back to Hong Kong

## Renewable Energy Landscape in Hong Kong

Hong Kong's current renewable energy usage is modest, with the government targeting <span style="color:orangered">**7.5% to 10%**</span> of its electricity from renewables by 2035, and **15%** beyond that. This landscape includes:

## **Solar Energy**:  
  - **Pros**:  
    - Utilizes available rooftop and building façade space.
    - Offers environmental benefits and potential cost savings.
  - **Cons**:  
    - Requires significant rooftop space, which is limited.
    - Variable output due to weather conditions.
  - **Short-term Impact**:  
    - Reduction in carbon emissions and potential energy savings.
  - **Long-term Impact**:  
    - Increased energy security if grid challenges (storage and integration) are managed.

## **Wind Energy**:  
  - **Pros**:  
    - Potential for offshore wind farms using the South China Sea.
    - Clean energy source that diversifies the energy mix.
  - **Cons**:  
    - High installation and maintenance costs.
    - Limited land availability for onshore installations.
  - **Short-term Impact**:  
    - Diversification of energy sources.
  - **Long-term Impact**:  
    - Could provide a stable renewable supply if technological and cost challenges are overcome.

## **Waste-to-Energy**:  
  - **Pros**:  
    - Addresses waste management issues.
    - Provides a steady and controllable energy source.
  - **Cons**:  
    - High operational costs and potential public opposition due to emissions.
  - **Short-term Impact**:  
    - Immediate benefits in waste reduction and energy generation.
  - **Long-term Impact**:  
    - Sustainable waste management, assuming strict environmental controls are in place.

## **Other Renewable Options (Hydro, Geothermal, Biomass, Tidal/Wave)**:  
  - **Application**:  
    - Limited due to Hong Kong’s geographic constraints.
  - **Impact**:  
    - Minimal short-term or long-term contribution compared to solar, wind, and waste-to-energy.

## Places to start considering your position statement

- **Global vs. Local Perspectives**:  
  - How do the global case studies differ from Hong Kong’s renewable energy potential and challenges?
  
- **Understanding Simplified Messaging**:  
  - What nuances are often omitted in public messaging about renewable energy? Why might these omissions be deliberate, and what are their consequences?

- **Policy and Implementation**:  
  - Considering Hong Kong’s space and cost constraints, what strategies could the government adopt to enhance renewable energy integration (e.g., technological innovations, grid improvements, energy storage)?

- **Long-Term Vision**:
  - How might Hong Kong's energy landscape evolve by 2100 or 2200? What realistic pathways can be envisioned to achieve energy security and sustainability?

# Activity: Energy Futures Debate

## Create Your Persona

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em;"}
**PRO-CLIMATE personas:**

- Environmentalist pushing for immediate coal phase-out
- Parent in Tuen Mun near power station
- Youth climate activist
- Renewable energy startup founder

**PRO-DEVELOPMENT personas:**

- CLP executive managing grid stability
- Factory owner worried about electricity costs
- Energy minister balancing competing demands
- Coal worker facing job uncertainty
:::

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 30px;"}
Who are you? What's your story? What do you fear losing?
:::

## Human Story: The Lignite Worker

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em; line-height: 1.8;"}
**Klaus** worked in German lignite mines for 30 years. His father and grandfather did too. The Energiewende shut his mine.

**PRO-CLIMATE says:** "Lignite is the dirtiest fuel. Closing the mines saved lives. Klaus can retrain."

**PRO-DEVELOPMENT says:** "Klaus is 55. He lost his pension. His town is dying. No one hired him. He voted for the far-right. Was the transition worth it?"

**The real question:** How do we transition justly — fast enough to save the planet, slow enough not to destroy communities?

## Remember: Fact-Check Your Stories

OK to Say
:::
::: {style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 15px;"}
- "Solar costs dropped 89% since 2010" *(IEA data)*
- "Ontario electricity prices doubled" *(Ontario Energy Board)*
- "Duck Curve creates grid challenges" *(CAISO documented)*

NOT OK
:::
::: {style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 15px;"}
- "Renewables can power everything now" *(ignores intermittency)*
- "Green energy destroys economies" *(exaggeration)*
- "Oil companies are literally killing people" *(unverifiable as stated)*
